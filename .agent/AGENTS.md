# Vumbua Comic Book Generation Guidelines

Always follow these rules when writing comic book storyboards or generating page images for Vumbua:

---

## 1. Page Budget, Panel Layout & Presentation

*   **Never truncate the page budget:** Scale pages to the number of major scenes in the clean transcript — typically 3–5 pages per major scene, 10–20 pages per full session. Do not compress.
*   **Mandatory Panel Count & Approach Justification Rule:** For EVERY page in a storyboard or implementation plan, the model MUST explicitly state and justify its choice of panel count, panel geometry, and visual layout approach in the page metadata header (`**Layout Justification:**`). You must explicitly explain:
    1. **Why this panel count was chosen** (e.g. why 1 splash panel vs 2 panels vs 3 panels fits the emotional pacing of the beat).
    2. **Why this panel geometry/cut was chosen** (e.g. why a diagonal slash split reflects a sudden rupture, why a 65/35 asymmetrical split creates focal hierarchy).
    3. **How it avoids formulaic grid defaults** and contrasts with adjacent pages.
*   **Mandatory Layout Variety & Flexibility (Anti-Grid Rule):** Storyboard writers MUST NOT default to a static 3-panel grid for every page. Avoid formulaic, repetitive panel structures across consecutive pages. Actively match the panel count and geometry to the emotional and narrative beats of each page:
    *   **1-Panel Full-Page Splash / Overlay:** High-impact revelations, epic vistas, or grand battle scenes. Can include stylized inset panels or floating narration boxes overlayed on top.
    *   **2-Panel Asymmetrical Vertical Split:** Great for wide establishing shots (65% top) transitioning into tight emotional close-ups or reactions (35% bottom).
    *   **2-Panel Dynamic High-Contrast Split:** Excellent for dramatic confrontations or presentation vs. explosive action transitions (50/50 split).
    *   **2-Panel Asymmetrical Diagonal / Side Split:** Ideal for parallel actions (e.g. 60% left scroll-burning / 40% full-height right tunnel/conduit transition).
    *   **2-Panel Progression leading to Splash:** Top half narrative return leading into a full-width bottom detailed splash (40/60 split).
    *   **3-Panel Tiered Grid:** Used selectively for multi-step conversations, fast step-by-step action sequences, or continuous spatial movement.
    *   **4-Panel Quad Grid:** Used for fast-paced multi-character reactions or rapid combat exchanges.
    *   **Rule:** No two consecutive pages should use the exact same layout structure unless explicitly justified (e.g., a two-page continuous splash spread). Every page header MUST explicitly specify its `**Layout Structure:**` and `**Layout Justification:**`.
*   **Environmental Transitions:** Always include explicit gutter transition descriptions (`#### 🖤 Gutter Transition:`) between panels to guide spatial and temporal shifts.
*   **Global Black Gutters:** All session storyboards must use a consistent black background and black gutter design (`Black gutters.`). Flashback sequences use dark gray (`#333`) gutter color. Specify this explicitly in every panel prompt.

---

## 2. Visual Style & Prompts

*   **Style tokens:** Use exactly this string as the opening of every image prompt:
    `Detailed 2D graphic novel style, clean expressive manga-style linework, crisp black ink outlines, cel-shaded color flats, cinematic volumetric lighting`
*   **No artist names:** Do not use "Carey Pietsch" or any other specific artist name.
*   **No HTML overlays:** All text, speech bubbles, narration boxes, and sound effects must be baked directly into the generated page art in the prompt. Do not use HTML/CSS overlays.
*   **Mandatory Explicit Skin Color & Full Physical Tokens:** Every character description token MUST specify a complete physical description including explicit skin tone/color (e.g., Caucasian/fair skin, dark brown skin, olivaceous green skin, light grey reptilian skin, packed-dirt clay brown skin, white fur). Never leave skin tone or physical ancestry ambiguous, or the image generator will drift between panels.
*   **No name leaks in visual descriptors:** Never use character names as visual descriptors for the image generator (e.g., "Loami stands in the doorway"). Always replace names with their exact physical description tokens as pulled from their profile files in that same turn. **EXCEPTION: Quoted text inside speech bubbles and narration boxes is PRINTED TEXT, not a visual descriptor. Character names inside quoted dialogue and narration MUST be preserved verbatim from the clean transcript.** The image generator renders quoted text as printed characters — it does not use names inside quotes to influence visual rendering of the character.


---

## 3. MANDATORY Pre-Generation & Planning Gate (DO NOT SKIP)

**Before writing any panel prompt, generating implementation plans, or calling `generate_image`, the following steps are REQUIRED:**

1.  **Read the clean transcript.** Call `view_file` on `sessions/transcripts/clean/sN-clean.md` for the session being storyboarded. Do not rely on memory or session summaries.
2.  **Read every character profile and location file** for entities in the scene. Call `view_file` on each relevant file.
3.  **Extract character and location tokens verbatim.** Copy the physical description lines directly into both the `implementation_plan.md` and the storyboard file.
4.  **Include Tokens in `implementation_plan.md` & STOP for Approval:** When planning a storyboard task, include the full proposed `## 👤 Character Reference Prompt Tokens` and `## 🏛️ Location Reference Prompt Tokens` sections in `implementation_plan.md`. **Stop execution and wait for explicit user approval of the tokens before proceeding to prompt writing or image generation.** Do not auto-approve or bypass this gate.
5.  **Check for reference images.** Call `list_dir` on `sessions/storyboards/assets/` to confirm existing assets.


> **Why this matters:** The model can inspect generated images using the `view_file` tool on the PNG paths to visually audit them inline, but it must never assume they are correct. The only protection against character drift is an accurate description pulled from ground-truth files in the same turn as generation, combined with a visual post-generation audit.

---

## 4. Visual Auditing and Human Approval Gate

**The model must visually audit all generated images.** Self-grading by merely reading back prompts is strictly banned. Instead, the model must call `view_file` on the generated PNG assets to visually inspect character features (e.g. Iggy's trench coat and moss sprouts, Loami's Cap and grease smudges) and panel structures before presenting them.

Rules:

*   **Pre-Screening Audit:** For every batch of images generated, the model must call `view_file` on the PNGs, perform a visual consistency check against the character profiles, and document any findings (such as missing sprouts or incorrect layout).
*   **Human Approval is the Final Gate:** After performing the visual audit, **stop and show the images and audit results to the user**. Do not proceed to the next page until the user explicitly confirms the characters look correct.
*   If the user (or the visual audit) identifies a character error, treat it as a **hard fail**. Rewrite the panel prompt from scratch using the ground-truth file text. Do not patch — rewrite.
*   **Do not run autonomous multi-page generation loops.** Generate 2–3 pages, visually audit, pause, show, confirm, then continue.

---

## 5. Zero-Tolerance for Hallucinated Features

Known character failure modes. Any page containing one of these is an automatic hard fail — rewrite the prompt and regenerate:

| Character | Common AI Failure | Correct Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Loami** | Drawn as a turquoise octopus creature | Rugged broad-shouldered humanoid male, short brown hair, short beard, brown woolen flat cap with tiny Italian flag ribbon, heavy canvas working collar, smudged with dark engine grease and soot |
| **Iggy** | Drawn as a turtle with a stone shell | Small clay-and-soil-kin humanoid-shaped creature of packed dirt and clay, packed dirt skin, green moss and small plant sprouts on head, oversized round copper goggles, dark oversized heavy wool trench coat. **NO SHELL.** |
| **Ignatious** | Drawn with generic red spiky hair or school uniform | Young male with literal burning flames for hair forming an active crown around dark hair, glowing yellow-orange eyes, dark hooded traveler's cloak |
| **"Octoumba"** | Misread as Loami's species | Octoumba is a geographical region/continent. Loami is humanoid. |

---

## 6. Location & World-Tech Consistency

Every storyboard MUST include a **`## 🏛️ Location Reference Prompt Tokens`** section at the top alongside character tokens. Do not accept generic AI backgrounds or modern tech tropes for named locations:

*   **Mandatory Location Tokens in Every Prompt:** Every prompt set in a named location must explicitly inject the full location reference token. Never rely on generic terms like "at the harbor" or "in the arena."
*   **Campus Harbor:** Low-profile grassy harbor islands with stone features connected by elegant stone walkways and bridges across a 1,700-foot-deep dark turquoise basin. The permanently moored Deep-Hull (a colossal Titanic-like iron steamship with brass fittings and glass canopies) is anchored in the background bay.
*   **Apex Arena:** A colossal half-mile-wide basalt canyon carved into natural cliff walls. Steep, terraced stone grandstands wrap around the canyon. Rows of heavy wooden desks are mounted directly onto the stone row below.
*   **Exam Slates (World Tech):** Exam slates are heavy copper-lined stone slabs with self-writing glowing text across their surfaces, weighted by a glowing copper-and-crystal paperweight. Never draw modern plastic/glass digital tablets.
*   **Zephyr interior bar/lounge:** Wood-paneled walls, polished brass fixtures, leather seating, warm amber lighting from gas lamps. NOT a generic balcony or outdoor terrace.
*   **The Colonnade:** Pillared marble hallway leading to airship berths. Crisp white stone with brass fixtures.

## 7. Dialogue Locking (Zero-Tolerance for Hallucinated Text)

**All speech bubbles and narration boxes baked into panel art must come verbatim from the clean transcript.** The image generator will invent plausible-sounding dialogue if not constrained — including fake character names, invented confrontations, and dramatic fabrications that never happened.

Rules:

*   **Two-Editor Pipeline Rule:** All speech bubbles and narration boxes baked into panel art must come directly from the novelized story file (`sessions/transcripts/clean/sN-clean-story.md`), which has been verified through our Two-Editor Audit Pipeline (Editor 1 0-Bias Audio Audit $\rightarrow$ Editor 2 Story & Pacing Audit).
*   **No improvised dialogue & No Table Meta-Talk:** Every line in a speech bubble must be an exact quote or novelized line from `sN-clean-story.md`. Strictly purge out-of-character dice chatter ("Support Tank!", "Armor slot!", "Ted Lasso biscuits") from image prompts and dialogue bubbles.
*   **Names ARE allowed inside quoted text.** The "no name leaks" rule (Section 2) applies to visual descriptors only. Speech bubble text like `"Aggie, where were you?"` must retain the name `Aggie` exactly as spoken in the transcript. The image generator renders quoted text as printed characters — it does not use names inside quotes to influence visual rendering. However, the image generator may INVENT fantasy names (e.g. "Kip", "Iñigo", "Alistair") if character identities are left ambiguous in the visual descriptor portion of the prompt. Always attribute speech bubbles to a character by physical description, not by name.
*   **No invented characters.** If a name appears in the generated image that does not appear in any character file or the clean transcript (e.g. "Alistair"), that page is an automatic hard fail. Rewrite the prompt from scratch.
*   **No escalated drama.** Do not describe scene dynamics as "confrontation", "argument", or "angry" if the transcript tone is casual or amicable. The generator will amplify the described tone — a "dispute" becomes a brawl, a "chat" becomes a standoff.
*   **Dynamic Narration Placement (No Rigid Clutter):** Use narration boxes purposefully to set scenes, establish atmosphere, signal time jumps, deliver GM lore, or highlight internal revelations. Do NOT force narration boxes onto every single panel—omit them during fast action beats, rapid combat exchanges, and character banter where visual art and clean speech bubbles drive the pacing.

---

## 8. Standalone Prompt Completeness

Every image prompt must be **fully self-contained.** The image generator has zero memory between calls. Rules:

*   **Full visual token required:** Every character visible in the panel must have their FULL visual description token repeated in that specific prompt. Do not use abbreviated references like "the nurse" or "the mechanic" — always include the complete physical description token from the character profile.
*   **Explicit Skin Color/Tone Required:** Every visual token MUST explicitly specify skin tone/color (e.g., Caucasian/fair skin, dark brown skin, olivaceous green skin, light grey reptilian skin, earthy clay skin, white fur) to prevent skin tone drift between panels.
*   **Speech bubble attribution by description:** Every speech bubble must include the full quoted text AND specify which character (by physical description, not name) it points from.

*   **No cross-page assumptions:** Never assume the generator will "remember" a character from a previous page. Each prompt is an island.
*   **Prompt validation before generation:** Before calling `generate_image`, verify each prompt against these rules. Use the `sessions/storyboards/scripts/validate_prompts.py` script if available.

---

## 9. NPC Grade-Level Integrity & Squad Validation Rules

**To prevent grade-level misclassifications and squad sorting errors during campaign planning, the model must follow these strict rules:**

1. **Grade-Level Separation (Zero Tolerance):**
   * **First-Year Cadets:** Compete in the freshman Loom sorting and Friday's Basalt Run.
   * **Second-Year Cadets:** Compete in upperclassman events (such as the Thursday Resonance Race) and operate in separate upperclassman crews. **NEVER mix Second-Year Cadets (e.g. Alistair Rook, Pudge, Dancer & Fabian, Vivi Frequency, Captain Gudge) into First-Year Loom squads.**
2. **Action-Based Grade Verification:** Before assigning any NPC to a squad or grade bracket, verify their narrative actions across played transcripts (`sessions/transcripts/clean/`):
   * Did they take Friday's entrance exam? -> **First-Year**
   * Did they pilot a rig in Thursday's Reso Race? -> **Second-Year**
3. **Mandatory Metadata Tagging:** Every NPC file in `characters/npcs/` must carry an explicit frontmatter category tag (`first-year`, `second-year`, `faculty`, or `notable-figure`).
4. **Validation Script Gate:** Run `python d:\Code\vumbua\characters\scripts\validate_npcs.py` before finalizing any squad rosters or campaign planning documents to guarantee 100% clean metadata compliance.

---

## 10. Raw Transcript Ground-Truth & Audit Rules (No-Heuristics Rule)

*   **Mandatory Line-by-Line Raw Reading (Zero Shortcuts):** When cleaning transcripts (`add-session`), novelizing story chapters (`sN-clean-story.md`), or building storyboards (`/storyboard`), the model MUST perform a direct, line-by-line reading of the raw session recording (`sessions/transcripts/raw/sN-raw.md`) using `view_file`. Relying on pre-generated summaries or memory is strictly prohibited.
*   **Prohibition of Python Heuristics as Ground-Truth Audits:** Python scripts and regex matchers are helper tools for formatting and audio manifest verification ONLY. They CANNOT detect dropped narrative beats, misattributed speakers, or table-talk leaks into dialogue. Never use Python script results to claim narrative completeness. The model must perform a direct LLM scene-by-scene audit.
*   **Mandatory 3-Tier Line Categorization (First-Pass Audit):** Every raw line must be explicitly categorized during the clean transcript pass (`sN-clean.md`):
    1. **Tier A: In-World Spoken Dialogue (`**[[Speaker]] (PC/NPC):** "..."`)** — Pure in-universe spoken lines. (Disentangle shared microphones like Luke S & Kristina/Aggie, and separate NPC dialogue from GM descriptions).
    2. **Tier B: Player Action & Intent Context (`*Player Action Intent:*`)** — Player descriptions of physical actions, emotional focus, or mechanical attempts (e.g. *"Britt is zoned and focused on following the turtle"* or *"Iggy places basalt rocks over bodies"*). **NEVER write these into character spoken quotes.** Editor 2 (Novelization) converts them into rich **Narrator Prose & Action**.
    3. **Tier C: Pure Technical & Meta Table Talk (`*Table Note:*`)** — Wi-Fi drops, Roll20 backups, character sheet HTML files, gas bills, and dice mechanics.
*   **Prohibition of Misrepresenting Internal Verification Scripts:** Scripts like `audit_manifest.py` only verify that extracted audio manifest blocks match the novelization file (`sN-clean-story.md`). They DO NOT verify parity against the raw audio transcript (`sN-raw.md`). The AI must NEVER claim a manifest script pass proves 100% dialogue parity with the raw recording.
*   **Zero Truncation of Gameplay Beats:** Every player action, NPC interaction, comedic beat, lore reveal, and environmental transition present in `sN-raw.md` must be fully represented in `sN-clean.md` and novelized in `sN-clean-story.md`.

---

## 11. Differential Gap Audit & Post-Mortem Protocol

*   **Mandatory Skill Usage:** Whenever the user identifies a missing gap, dropped dialogue interjection, or turn-order error, the model MUST activate the `session-audit` skill (`.agents/skills/session-audit/SKILL.md`).
*   **4-Pass Verification Suite Gate:** Before presenting any clean transcript or novelized story file for approval, run:
    1. `python sessions/scripts/verify_manifest.py sN`
    2. `python sessions/scripts/verify_parity.py sN`
    3. `python sessions/scripts/audit_transcript_gaps.py sN`
    4. `python sessions/scripts/audit_s12_raw_coverage.py`
*   **Post-Mortem Logging:** Every identified failure mode (gist truncation, keyword coarseness, OOC leaks, phonetic STT errors) must be documented in the Post-Mortem Register in `session-audit/SKILL.md` to prevent regression across future sessions.
