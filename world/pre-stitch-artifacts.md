# Pre-Stitch Artifacts (Ancient Tech)

Rusted, non-magical metal gears, combustion engines, and plastic found in the trash vortex.

## Harmony View: "Primitive Scrap"

Useless junk from civilizations that failed to achieve Harmony. Protocol: Melt it down for raw materials.

## What Players Know

Old mechanical parts occasionally turn up in scrap heaps. The Academy considers them worthless curiosities.

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### Clan View (Earthkin/Mizizi): "The Old Iron"

Remnants of the "First Weavers" who built the world without magic.

### The Critical Truth

This tech doesn't require the Loom to function. **It is immune to "[[the-minimum|The Minimum]]."**

When the magic fails---and it will---Pre-Stitch technology is the only thing that will still work. Combustion engines, kinetic weapons, mechanical clocks---all of it runs on physics, not on the Harmony grid.

### Recent Incident

Old Man Silas (Squad 05) found a "Combustion Generator" (a diesel engine). He got it running. It's loud and smelly, but it **never flickers**. The Academy confiscated it as "Contraband."

### Silas Thorne's Collection

[[silas-thorne|Silas Thorne]] collects Pre-Stitch tech not for greed, but because he believes these machines are the only things that will work when the magic/Venture fails. He is the party's best source for these items.

### Plot Significance

Pre-Stitch artifacts represent the ultimate insurance policy against the Minimum. If the party can secure a supply of working Pre-Stitch technology, they have a bargaining chip that transcends the entire power structure of Harmony.
