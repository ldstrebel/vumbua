# The Circuit-Run

> *"I also hear there is a RESO-RACE coming after the first week of classes! A perfect place to prove your metal to the Captains."*
> — [[Valerius Sterling]], radio broadcast

The **Circuit-Run** (colloquially: **Reso Race**) is the most popular sport in Harmony. It is a brutal combination of exploration race, engineering competition, and religious simulation of the "Great Stitching" — the ancient conquest that unified Harmony's territory.

---

## Core Concept

Teams or soloists pilot custom craft (**Venture-Rigs**) through a wilderness arena, racing to **strike Spires** (simulated nodes) and siphon their energy. Once a team has accumulated enough resonance to overcome their craft's energy handicap, they must reach the **Grand Resonator** at the arena's centre and discharge everything. The first team to light the Grand Resonator wins.

The genius of the format: **bigger, more powerful ships need MORE energy**. A sailboat crew might only need a few minor nodes. A dreadnought crew needs dozens. This creates natural strategic tension between speed, firepower, and efficiency.

## The Arena: The Apex Ring

The Circuit-Run takes place in a massive natural geographic basin called the **Apex Ring**.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Size** | ~1 mile wide |
| **Terrain** | Static wilderness — canyons, petrified forests, dry sea-beds, open water |
| **Layout** | Consistent across all Harmony venues, but updated to reflect newly integrated territory |
| **Grand Resonator** | Towering obsidian pylon at the exact centre — the finish line |
| **Rim** | Operates like an airport — circular tram system with stops along the way |
| **Start Line** | At the basin's southern rim; rigs are dropped or slung from the amphitheaters |

### This Year's Special Layout

The arena layout is being **updated for the first time** to include the **Ash-Blood Isles** and the **Mizizi Forest island**. This is a huge deal — the entire population is seeing simulated versions of the newest territories for the first time.

> **GM Note:** Part of the Reso Race's purpose is to **teach Harmony's people about newly integrated land** — what it looks like, what resources it produces, what it brings to the Republic. The race is propaganda as much as sport.

### The Controversy: Missing Ash-Blood Node

The Spire locations are determined by [[scrivener-guild|Scrivener Guild]] calculations based on known node resonance values. **However, the Ash-Blood node data has not been released.** Despite the terrain reflecting the Ash-Blood Isles, there is no Ash-Blood Spire in the arena.

This is a point of public disappointment and quiet controversy. The Scriveners claim the numbers aren't finalised. The truth is more complicated — the [[The Power System|Ash-Blood Anomaly]] means the expected +300 to +800 amp surge only produced ~20 amps. Releasing those numbers would expose the failure.

## The Energy System: "Stored Connection"

The Circuit-Run's mechanics are built on the same technology as [[The Power System|Vox Crystal Batteries]], but used in a clever reverse application.

### How It Works

1. **Umber crystals** normally store a **connection to the land** — allowing devices to operate away from nodes by "convincing" the resonator it's still part of Harmony's territory (see [[The Power System#Innovation 2 Stored Connection]])
2. In a Circuit-Run, umber crystals are used **backwards** — they **sever** the craft's natural connection to the ambient ether field
3. This creates an artificial "dead zone" around the Rig — it operates at **zero power** until the crew reconnects
4. The crew must then **manually reopen** that connection by striking Spires and siphoning node energy
5. The amount of reconnection needed depends on the craft's power draw:

| Craft Type | Power Draw | Nodes Needed | Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Racing sailboat | Near-zero | A few minor nodes | Speed + agility, avoid conflict |
| Standard Venture-Rig | Medium | Several mixed nodes | Balanced approach |
| Heavy land-ship | High | Many nodes, including majors | Crew-heavy, can fight for contested nodes |
| Gryphon rider | Special | Massive (see note) | Only the heater is "powered"; the gryphon itself is free energy, but handicapped by an artificial umber gutter |

### The Win Condition

A team wins when their accumulated resonance **exceeds the Global Amplitude** plus their craft's rated power draw. At that point, they have enough "connection" to light the Grand Resonator.

- A low-power sailboat only needs to slightly exceed Global Amplitude
- A high-power dreadnought must generate connection equal to Global Amplitude **plus** its own massive energy consumption
- This is what makes the sport strategically interesting — raw power is a liability

> **Connection to [[professor-kante|Professor Kante]]'s Lessons:** The Circuit-Run is a practical demonstration of everything Kante teaches. The "stored connection" mechanic, the relationship between nodes and Global Amplitude, the difference between energy and connection — students who paid attention in class have a genuine advantage understanding the race.

## The Craft: Venture-Rigs

Teams or soloists bring their own mechanical crafts. There are no restrictions on size or crew count, but every craft must follow these rules:

### Mandatory Equipment

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Harvest-Prong** | A copper-and-crystal rod that physically strikes a Spire to siphon energy. Every rig must have one. |
| **Umber Gutter** | The reversed umber crystal that creates the artificial dead zone. Calibrated to the craft's rated power. |
| **HTech Power System** | The craft **must** be powered by Harmony technology in order to store the connection. No natural/organic power sources allowed (this is why gryphon riders are heavily handicapped). |

### Craft Scaling

Rigs have **no internal engines** in the traditional sense — they move only as long as they have an active "Node-Sync" in their battery. The initial drop from the rim gives momentum, but after that, everything depends on how quickly you can strike your first Spire.

---

## The Spires (Nodes)

During the **Loom-Pulse** at the start of each match, massive metallic pillars erupt from the ground in semi-randomised locations across the basin.

### Spire Rules

- **Randomised placement:** Locations are calculated by the [[scrivener-guild|Scrivener Guild]], but appear random to spectators
- **New spires emerge** as the race progresses — some appear mid-match
- **Limited charges:** Each Spire has a finite number of "syncs." Once depleted, it retracts into the ground, forcing latecomers to explore deeper
- **Major Nodes** are always the most sought-after — they provide the biggest connection boost but are heavily contested

### Syncing with a Spire

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| **1. Tune** | The pilot matches the Rig's frequency to the Spire's vibration |
| **2. Strike** | The Rig physically touches the Spire with the Harvest-Prong |
| **3. Consume** | The connection energy is absorbed into the Rig's umber gutter |

### Node Spectrum

Each node type grants a temporary **Boon** — a power-up that lasts until the next sync.

| Energy Type | Resonance | Boon | Amplitude Sync |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Leidian** (Ash-Blood) | 85–95 | **Overclock:** Extreme speed; "Phase-Dash" (20ft teleport). Risk: high heat/stress. | High (80%) |
| **Vitruvian** (Vox) | 40–60 | **Capacitance:** Doubles the duration of the next node power you strike. | Low (30%) |
| **Crystalline** (Renali) | 50–70 | **Malleable Frame:** Hull becomes semi-fluid glass. Pass through cracks or heal damage. | Medium (50%) |
| **Aero-Static** (Foundational) | 20–40 | **Weightless Drift:** Gravity -90%. Massive jumps and vertical climbing. | Low (20%) |
| **Kinetic-Echo** (Foundational) | 60–80 | **Ghost-Track:** Leaves a hard-light trail for instant U-turns. | High (75%) |

> **Note:** Only Ash-Blood energy has clan-specific integration so far. Future seasons may add Mizizi, Wadi, and Renali node types.

## Rules of Engagement

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **No killing** | Everything else is fair game inside the basin |
| **No stealing connection energy** | Once absorbed, connection is locked to that rig's umber gutter |
| **Destruction is strategy** | A valid approach is to destroy all other rigs and then finish at your own pace |
| **Battery ownership doesn't matter** | The winning team doesn't have to be the original owner of the battery — if you can get your hands on a charged battery and bring it to the Grand Resonator, that counts |

## Viewing the Spectacle: The Three Tiers

Spectator access reflects Harmony's class structure.

### 1. The Gilded Zephyrs (Elite)
- Luxury airships with **Magnifying Glass Floors** ([[Renali]]-made)
- Patrons look directly down onto the rigs from above
- Strict altitude rules; limited number of ships allowed
- Only 3 flight lanes permitted

### 2. The Rim-Tracker (Middle Class)
- A high-speed steam **trolley** that runs along the edge of the arena
- Circles the basin rim, rushing to follow the most exciting syncs
- Passengers can hop on and off at stations along the route
- Operates at intervals; moves like a **ski chair lift** between stops

### 3. The Bleacher-Walls (The Masses)
- Stone amphitheaters built into the basin's lip
- Fans use brass binoculars and act as **"Scout-Spotters"** — shouting coordinates to teams below
- The most raucous, passionate viewing experience
- Can hop on and off the Rim-Tracker trolleys from here

## Notable Racing Archetypes

### The Soloist ("Stinger")
Uses a light cycle or racing craft. Relies on agility, **Aero-Static** jumps, and hitting every Spire on the path. Minimal power draw means minimal nodes needed, but zero margin for error in a fight.

### The Seven-Man Crew ("Goliath")
Uses a massive land-ship. Requires a **Pilot** (navigation), **Harpooners** (striking Spires from distance), and **Engineers** (managing heat from Leidian energy). Enormous power draw means they need many Major Nodes.

### The Couples Racer ("Dancer")
Two-person sailboat. Lowest possible power rating. They are expert runners, climbers, and sailors — if they get a good draw on minor nodes away from contested areas, they have a real shot. But if they encounter a Goliath, they surrender.

## The First Vumbua Circuit-Run

> This year's race is **historic** — it's the first Circuit-Run at [[Vumbua Academy]] to feature the updated terrain with the Ash-Blood Isles and Mizizi Forest.

### Confirmed Teams

| # | Team | Craft | Strategy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Shatter Stamper** | Heavy rig, 3-person crew | Brute force | — |
| 2 | **Sail & Stun** | Fast sailing vessel | Speed + disruption | Connected to [[Pudge]] |
| 3 | **Marble Wall** | Dominant heavy body | Animal stampede; capitalise on chaos; crush smaller teams then sweep remaining nodes | Strategy: destroy first, collect later |
| 4 | **[[Pudge]]** | Hull racer / fast gyro-boat | Speed + gryphon hybrid | Gryphons are resource-intensive — needs massive connection to reach Global Amplitude. Only the saddle heater is "powered"; the gryphon is free energy but handicapped by an artificial umber gutter |
| 5 | **Dancer & Fabian** | Racing sailboat (2-person) | Lowest power rating; expert runners, climbers, sailors | Need minor nodes away from contention. If they hit a good draw, real contenders. If they meet Marble Wall, they surrender. |

> [!NOTE]
> **TODO:** Flesh out team details. Simulate race outcome and generate a play-by-play for the Session 3 spectacle.

## Cultural Significance

The Circuit-Run is more than sport. It is a **simulation of the Great Stitching** — the historical conquest that unified Harmony's territory. Every race is a miniature version of the original exploranauts who ventured into unknown land, struck nodes, and brought that connection back to the centre.

For students at [[Vumbua Academy]], the Reso Race is:
- A chance to **impress the Captains** ahead of internship interviews
- A practical demonstration of [[The Power System|node science]] and the connection/energy distinction
- A window into what life on a **venture journey** will actually look like
