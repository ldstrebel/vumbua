## I

**Inverse Power Doctrine**
- Harmony grants the newest integrated member the **highest voting power**
- *"The least of us should become the most of us"*
- Prevents exploitation of new members' resources by ensuring they make decisions about their own lands

- Has kept the peace for a thousand years
- Revealed by [[serra-vox|Serra Vox]] in [[session-02|Session 2]] *(Scene 3: Cultural Exchange)*

**Integration**
- The process of connecting a new Node to Harmony
- Requires two-way energy flow (Inward + Outward)
