- The original power infrastructure of Harmony
- No surge protection---caused the Night of Sparks when overloaded

**Crystal Batteries** (Vox Batteries)
- Built by House Vox using umber crystals from Umbra Mountain
- NOT traditional batteries---they regulate the connection to the ether field, like wireless chargers
- Two innovations: surge protection (caps power intake) and stored connection (allows operation away from nodes)
- Current generation: **Panda line** (550 amps, car-battery sized, lasts ~1 year)
- Scrapped next generation: **Apex 1** (designed for a post-Ash-Blood surge that never came)

- Historical: ~350 (400 years ago) → ~450+ (post-Night of Sparks) → ~600 (Era 4 peak) → ~600 declining (present)
- The Ash-Blood integration should have added +300 to +800 but only added ~20

## I

**Inverse Power Doctrine**
- Harmony grants the newest integrated member the **highest voting power**
- *"The least of us should become the most of us"*
- Prevents exploitation of new members' resources by ensuring they make decisions about their own lands
- [[Lady Ignis]] ([[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]] matriarch) currently holds the highest voting power---essentially "President" of Harmony
- Has kept the peace for a thousand years
- Revealed by [[Serra Vox]] in [[session-02|Session 2]] *(Scene 3: Cultural Exchange)*

**Integration**
- The process of connecting a new Node to Harmony
- Requires two-way energy flow (Inward + Outward)
- Creates Safe Lanes and amplifies both realities

**Inward Flow**
- Raw materials from new Node power Harmony tech
- Must be at 100% efficiency
