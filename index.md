# Welcome to Vumbua

> *"We do not conquer land; we wake it up."*

## About the Campaign

Vumbua is a **Daggerheart campaign** set in a Magitek-Steampunk world inspired by *Atlantis: The Lost Empire*. The world is being literally stitched together through a process called **The Great Stitching**, where isolated civilizations and their reality-Nodes are integrated into a growing empire called **Harmony**.

### The Setting

**[[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]]** is a mobile city-state that has just relocated to a new frontier after 80 years of stagnation. For the first time in generations, new lands have been discovered—and new mysteries await.

The Academy has accepted its largest intake class ever: 100,000 candidates. Most won't make it through the trials.

### The Players

Our story follows five unlikely students:
- **[[britt|Britt]]** - A gray fungal-turtle [[mizizi|Mizizi]], suspicious of Harmony's motives
- **[[aggie|Aggie]]** - [[britt|Britt]]'s cousin, a red-spotted [[mizizi|Mizizi]] seeking answers
- **[[ignatius|Ignatius]]** - An Ash-Blood on a pilgrimage to find new heat for his clan
- **[[lomi|Lomi]]** - A Harmony-born boiler room worker, proud of his craft
- **[[iggy|Iggy]]** - A mysterious [[Trench-Kin|Earthkin]] tinkerer with endless curiosity
