## Overview

Settika is built around the Prism Falls — a water source that reveals the true nature of whatever it touches. Rot, disease, structural weakness, and hidden flaws become immediately visible when Prism Falls water is poured over them. The water is used across Harmony for medicine, engineering inspection, and food safety.

In [[Nstyl]] and other frontier cities, Prism Falls water carries an almost sacred reverence — people trust what the water reveals about a person's nature. This belief can be exploited by those who understand how the water actually works.

## Session 3 Relevance

[[Azor]], a street-smart Settikan, used Prism Falls water to manipulate [[Tus]] and [[Zyykl]] from [[Nstyl]], convincing them they were "true Exploranauts" who deserved a place at [[Vumbua Academy]]. The water *does* reveal true nature — but Azor's interpretation of it was the lie.
