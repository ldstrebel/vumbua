## Overview

Bloomfield produces Clockwork Blooms — flowers that bloom with mechanical precision every 60 seconds. For centuries, Clockwork Blooms were the standard unit of timekeeping across Harmony before more precise instruments were developed. The [[Scrivener Guild]] adopted these as their timekeeping standard, essential for synchronising maps, logs, and research across the empire. The blooms retain historical significance and are still used ceremonially.
