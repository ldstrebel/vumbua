# Block 04

## Overview

Block 04 is the housing block assigned to [[mizizi|Mizizi]] students. It consists of modular units built into a terraced cliff face, resembling a repurposed green room — a style that would feel somewhat familiar to forest-dwellers accustomed to hollowed mega-flora.

## What Players Know

The dorm is built into a terraced cliff, with modular units stacked along the rock face. The green, organic styling sets it apart from the industrial Block 99 or standard Block 12. [[britt|Britt]] and [[aggie|Aggie]] were assigned here during intake but chose to explore the campus rather than go directly to their room.
