## Overview

Relina is built around the Soft Forge — a lake in which anything submerged immediately loses its rigid shape and becomes malleable. While within the lake, objects can be reshaped freely. Extremely dangerous — works on organic matter too, so hands lose their shape if submerged. The city constantly innovates clever tools and techniques for safe use. It is Harmony's premier metallurgy and crafting centre.
