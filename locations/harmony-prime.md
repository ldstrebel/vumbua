# Harmony Prime (The Seat)

> *"The Seat of Harmony. It's the biggest city... huge. 8 million people."*
> — [[Serra Vox]], [[session-02\|Session 2]]

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Capital city |
| **Population** | ~8 million |
| **Government** | High Council (Domestic Council) |
| **Key Figures** | [[Lady Ignis]] (highest voting power) |
| **First Mentioned** | [[session-02\|Session 2]] |

Harmony Prime is the static capital city of the Harmony Empire, far from the frontier where [[Vumbua Academy]] currently operates. It is the seat of the High Council and the administrative center of the empire.

## What Players Know

[[Serra Vox]] revealed during [[session-02|Session 2]] that the capital has approximately 8 million people. She slipped that she'd spent time there under "political pressure" — hinting at her hidden noble background as a member of House Vox.

[[Lady Ignis]], the [[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]] matriarch, serves on the High Council here. Under the [[Inverse Power Doctrine]], she holds the highest voting power of any council member.
