Harmony Prime is the static capital city of the Harmony Empire, far from the frontier where [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]] currently operates. It is the seat of the High Council and the administrative center of the empire.

## What Players Know

[[serra-vox|Serra Vox]] revealed during [[session-02|Session 2]] that the capital has approximately 8 million people. She slipped that she'd spent time there under "political pressure" — hinting at her hidden noble background as a member of House Vox.

[[lady-ignis|Lady Ignis]], the [[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]] matriarch, serves on the High Council here. Under the [[Inverse Power Doctrine]], she holds the highest voting power of any council member.
