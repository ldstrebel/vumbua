## What Players Know

Described during [[session-01|Session 1]] as part of the courtyard reveal: a smaller vessel with an airship balloon tied to it, dwarfing the students below. [[dean-isolde-vane|Dean Isolde Vane]] has her chaotic office here.

[[zephyr|Zephyr]] is part of [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Vane]]'s inner circle, participating in late-night wind-pattern research sessions in the Sky-Spire.
