# The Ash-Blood Isles

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Clan territory — volcanic chain |
| **Clan** | [[Ash-Bloods]] |
| **Integration Status** | 100% (24 months ago) |
| **Discovered By** | Captain Elara Thorne |
| **Current Significance** | [[Vumbua Academy]]'s current location |
| **First Mentioned** | [[session-00\|Session 0]] |

The Ash-Blood Isles are a chain of volcanic mountains with perpetual smoke and magma flows. The [[Ash-Bloods]] live among the vents and lava tubes, where temperatures would kill most other beings. [[Vumbua Academy]] relocated here 6 months ago.

## What Players Know

The volcanic chain is visible on the horizon from the edge of the [[Mizizi Petrified Forest]]. During [[session-00|Session 0]], the GM described: *"You can see on the horizon the smoke of their perpetual volcano."*

The Isles were discovered 24 months ago by **Captain Elara Thorne** — just one week after [[valentine-sterling-sr|Valentine Sterling Sr.]] found the [[Mizizi]]. The [[The Power System|Panda line batteries]] (which could store a connection to the land for up to 3 days outside a node) made both discoveries possible.

### Leidian
The Isles produce **leidian** — an obsidian-like heat stone that burns 80% hotter per gram since integration. It has a halflife oscillation (heat tapers then rises) and loses potency with distance from the Isles. Used in [[Vumbua Academy]]'s boiler room alongside crystal batteries.

### The Great Cooling
Before Harmony's arrival, the [[Ash-Bloods]] were experiencing "The Great Cooling" — their volcanoes were slowly dying. After integration, the heat returned. This is the core reason the clan embraced Harmony.
