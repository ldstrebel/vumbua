## What Players Know

### The Power Plant
The power plant within the Walker-Core has "Vumbua POWER" written over its archway. Inside is a large warehouse with machinery — glowing gems plugged into panels, connected to whirring cogs and rotating machines. Turbines powered by [[The Power System|Panda 5 resonator batteries]], with a catwalk level containing offices and a chalkboard covered in [[professor-kante|Professor Kante]]'s research notes.

[[Iggy]] explored the interior during [[session-02.5|Session 2.5]], discovering the battery infrastructure and meeting [[professor-kante|Professor Kante]].
