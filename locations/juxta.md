## Overview

Juxta produces Lift Stone — when an object is fully encapsulated in it, the object weighs only half what it should. The stone itself is just barely weightless (net-zero weight). Lift Stone is essential for construction, shipping, and the mobile architecture of cities like [[Vumbua Academy]].
