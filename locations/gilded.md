## Overview

Gilded is the ancestral seat of [[house-gilded|House Gilded]]. The Chime Spires — massive, musical, organ-like structures — synchronise raw ether into usable power. They are the foundation of Harmony's entire energy infrastructure, making Gilded arguably the most important city in the empire.

The original spires still function as the backbone of the power grid, though [[house-gilded|House Gilded]]'s financial stability is increasingly precarious as the Crystal Banks run low on reserves.
