# The Spire-Scape

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Temporary urban district |
| **Parent Location** | [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]] |

| **First Mentioned** | [[session-01\|Session 1]] |

The Spire-Scape is the temporary city assembled around [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]]'s three permanent Cores. It makes up approximately 70% of the Academy's total structures — a chaotic mix of scaffolding, prefab dorms, and rapid construction clinging to the permanent buildings.

## What Players Know

Upon landing at the [[ash-blood-isles|Ash-Blood Isles]] 6 months ago, thousands of "Worker-Constructs" swarmed out to assemble the temporary city. It feels like a high-tech refugee camp mixed with a World's Fair — steam cranes dropping loads of materials, ley-lines laid directly into the dirt, and a forest of scaffolding everywhere.

The Spire-Scape contains:
- Student housing blocks ([[block-04|Block 04]], [[block-12|Block 12]], [[block-99|Block 99]])
- [[Greek Row]] — Posh social clubs
- The "Fancy District" — Northwest quadrant with manors, shops, and the [[celestial-lounge|Celestial Lounge]]
- The [[Industrial Zone]] — Where cranes drop construction materials
- The Clan Assistance Office
- The [[Great Library]]
