## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Industrial district / Student housing |

Block 99 is an industrial district within [[Vumbua Academy]]'s campus, built around a repurposed **geothermal plant** with steam stacks rising from the building. It serves as both Copper/Worker-tier housing and a social gathering space.

## What Players Know

### Physical Description
A geothermal plant with steam constantly venting from its stacks. The building doubles as student housing for Copper-rank and worker-track students. [[Lomi]] recognized it immediately as his kind of place — the steam stacks reminded him of the boiler room.

### The Bonfire Pit
Adjacent to Block 99 is the makeshift **bonfire pit** that became the social hub during intake week. Students dug a fire pit using construction trash and debris. This is where the party's first major social gathering took place during [[session-02|Session 2]].

Key events at the bonfire:
- [[Cassius Thorne]] obsessively arranged logs for "optimal thermal distribution"
- [[Lomi]] and [[Ignatius]] lit the fire together
- [[Serra Vox]] approached [[Britt]] and [[Aggie]] about [[Mizizi]] culture
- The [[Percival Vane-Smythe III|Speculators' Debate]] introduced the Sixfold Theory
- [[Zephyr]]'s purple lightning bolt struck from a clear sky
- [[Rill]] retrieved [[Zephyr]] and invited [[Britt]]/[[Aggie]] to visit

### Block 99-Piston
The residential sub-block where [[Lomi]] bunks with [[Ratchet]] (a Copper-rank cynic with a brass prosthetic hand) and [[Soot]] (an anxious Rust-rank student).
