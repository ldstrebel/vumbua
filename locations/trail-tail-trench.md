# Trail-Tail Trench

> Bioluminescent seeds in the deep water — swim through and leave a trail of light.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Frontier Node (Wild) |
| **Node Resource** | Trail-Tail Seeds |
| **Node Rating** | Minor (+5 to +30 amps) |
| **Clan Territory** | [[Trench-Kin]] |
| **Status** | Not integrated — no settlement |

## Overview

Trail-Tail Seeds are found in the deep waters of [[Trench-Kin]] territory. When ingested, they cause the consumer to leave a glowing trail of light behind them, like a Tron light-cycle. Fish in the trench use the seeds naturally, creating bioluminescent trails through the dark water.

There is no city or settlement here — this is a wild node in Trench-Kin territory. It represents a potential future integration target for Harmony, though the Trench-Kin remain hidden.
