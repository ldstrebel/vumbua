# Nstyl

> A city where sound is impossible. Everyone speaks in gesture. Names exist only in the shape of a hand.

| **Status** | Integrated |

## Overview

Nstyl is built around a deposit of Silent Silt — when a handful or more of this silt is gathered in one spot, it absorbs all sound in the surrounding area. The city that grew around this node communicates entirely through sign language. Spoken language is physically impossible there.

Silent Silt is used across Harmony in stealth operations, hospitals, and sound-sensitive environments.

## Naming Convention

Nstyl names are **signed, not spoken.** Each person's name is a specific hand-sign — a gesture, not a word. The written forms (e.g. "Nstyl," "Zyykl," "Tus") are phonetic approximations created by outsiders attempting to transcribe the hand-shapes into letters.

Different speakers produce wildly different pronunciations of the same name — "Zyykl" might become "Zekelef" or "Zickle" depending on who's trying to say it. Nstyl people consider this amusing, not offensive. Their real names exist only in gesture.

## Session 3 Relevance

**[[Tus]] and [[Zyykl]]** are two young men from Nstyl who failed the [[Vumbua Academy]] entrance exam. They were manipulated by [[Azor]] from [[Settika]], who used [[Prism Falls]] water to convince them they deserved a second chance. They serve as the muscle in the Session 3 ambush encounter — sign-language-coordinating fighters who can't speak, making them eerie and unsettling opponents.
