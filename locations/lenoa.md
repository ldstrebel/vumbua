## Overview

Lenoa produces Friction Needles — two needles struck together eliminate friction from the next friction interaction they encounter, until the needles break. Strike the pair, touch them to an ice skate, and the skate glides across ground as if on ice — the friction is absorbed into the needles instead of being applied. Used extensively in transportation and industrial applications.
