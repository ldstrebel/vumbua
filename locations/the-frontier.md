# The Frontier

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Uncharted territories |
| **Status** | Beyond Safe Lanes |

The Frontier refers to the uncharted territories beyond Harmony's established Safe Lanes. It is the reason [[Vumbua Academy]] exists — to train explorers (Exploranauts) who can venture into unknown lands, make contact with new civilizations, and establish integration.

## What Players Know

After 80 years of stagnation during [[The Silent Era]], the Frontier has reopened. The discovery of the [[Ash-Blood Isles]] and the [[Mizizi Petrified Forest]] 24 months ago ended the drought and reignited the spirit of exploration. [[Dean Isolde Vane]]'s welcome speech captured this excitement: *"For 80 years... our maps have been static! We've missed the thrill of adventure."*

The Frontier is filled with dangers from [[The Bleed]] — where reality pixelates and fades — and creatures like [[Void-Beast|Void-Beasts]], [[Ether-Jelly|Ether-Jellies]], and [[Whispering Moth|Whispering Moths]].
