# The Celestial Lounge

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Upscale social club |
| **Parent Location** | [[Vumbua Academy]] — Northwest "Fancy District" |
| **First Appearance** | [[session-02\|Session 2]] |

The Celestial Lounge is an upscale club occupying the top floor of the tallest building in the northwest "fancy district" of [[Vumbua Academy]].

## What Players Know

Located in the northwest quadrant of campus, past the manor houses and ritzy shops. The area has a distinctly wealthy atmosphere — three huge manors, Greek Row-style social clubs, and bouncers at doors. Students can voluntarily reveal their rank receipts to receive gold pins and VIP access, though nobody checks IDs.

The party headed to the Celestial Lounge at the end of [[session-02|Session 2]] after the bonfire wound down. [[Iggy]] rejoined the group for this outing after his solo adventure in the [[Power Plant]] during [[session-02.5|Session 2.5]].
