# 🗺️ World Lore

**World Setting: The Unfolding**  
**Campaign System:** Daggerheart (v1.5/1.6) **Theme:** Atlantis: The Lost Empire meets Magitek Steampunk. **Core Conflict:** Exploration vs. Stagnation.  
**I. The Cosmology: The Great Stitching**  
The world is not a static globe; it is a disjointed reality waiting to be pulled together.

* **The Magnetic Pull:** Nodes act as gravity wells for reality. When a new Node is claimed and harmonized, it physically pulls the new continent slowly toward the central Harmony continent. The world is literally being built/stitched together over time.  
* **The Threat (The Ether/Nether):** If civilization stops expanding, the reality of the claimed lands begins to dissolve. This has happened before, creating the "Dissolved Lands."  
* **The Crisis (The Minimum):** For centuries, Harmony has had excess power. Now, for the first time, they are approaching "The Minimum." If they dip below this threshold, Harmony tech (lights, trains, medical devices) will begin to lose charge.

**II. The Hub: Vumbua Academy ("The Safiri")**  
*Name subject to change based on language preference.*  
The Academy is the heart of **The Harmony**. It is a mobile city-state that teleports to the frontier.

* **The Current State:** The Academy has just transferred to a massive new Terra with 2 potential Nodes. However, early scans suggest these Nodes are "shattered" or weak. They are not the savior battery Harmony hoped for.  
* **The "Great Cull" Strategy:** Recognizing the desperation, the University has radically shifted its admissions policy.  
  * **Class Size:** The largest in history.  
  * **The Philosophy:** They expect 95% attrition during the "Trials" and another 20% loss during "Intern Voyages."  
  * **The Goal:** Stop training "Glory Seekers" and start manufacturing "Survivalists."  
* **Aesthetics:** High-Magitek. Brass, steam, crystal focusing lenses. But currently, the lights flicker occasionally—a secret terror for those who know why.

**III. The Explorer Castes**  
Harmony has two distinct types of explorers, often at odds:

1. **The Vanguard (The Front Runners):**  
   * **Role: They sail/ride off the edge of the map. They find where Nodes *likely* are.**  
   * **Vibe: Undisciplined, chaotic, glory-seeking. They rely on instinct. The map "unfurls" under their feet.**  
   * **Reputation: Rockstars, but unreliable.**  
2. **The Second Wave (The Grid-Makers):**  
   * **Role: They take the chaotic maps of the Vanguard and verify them. They ensure no Node was missed.**  
   * **Vibe: Methodical, scientific, disciplined.**  
   * **Reputation: The "Cleaners." They are currently being prioritized by the Academy because the Vanguard has missed things in their arrogance.**

**IV. The Factions**  
**1\. The Harmony (The New Empire)**

* **Philosophy:** Expansion is life.  
* **Strategic Paths:**  
  1. **Assimilation:** Convince found Clans to join Harmony (boosts Node efficiency).  
  2. **Discovery:** Find new Clans/Nodes in the Terra.  
  3. **The Unknown:** Go completely off the chart to find raw, unclaimed power.  
* **Harmony Tech:** Driven by "Crystal Batteries." These are links to the central network. They are designed to be power-capped to prevent overloads, but they are currently running lean.

**2\. The Remnants (The Failed Empire)**  
These Clans stagnated because they stayed "Natural" and "Low Tech." They adapted to their specific biome but failed to stitch the world together.

* **Clan Tech:** Non-existent. They use specialized, nature-based efficiency (e.g., bioluminescence instead of lightbulbs, beast-labor instead of engines). They are incredibly efficient at *one thing* but lack the versatility of Harmony.

**A. The Volcano Clan (The Pyre-Keepers)**

* **Status:** *Allied.*  
* **Biome:** Volcanic vents.  
* **The Node:** Heat/Fire.  
* **Motivations & Culture:**  
  * **The Contract of Blood:** They maintain a strict exchange of bloodlines to prevent corruption and inbreeding.  
  * **The Softening:** The Clan is physically thriving due to Harmony's medicine and food, but culturally, the elders fear they are becoming "soft." The Embers that used to require immense effort to heat a room now burn effortlessly with Harmony tech, making the youth complacent.  
  * **The Belief:** "Keep the Nodes warm with companionship." They view the fire as a living entity that requires social presence to survive.  
  * **The Fear:** If the world runs out of places to expand, the "Curse of Ash" will return, freezing their vents.

**B. The River Clan (The Wadi)**

* **Status:** *Hostile / Isolationist.*  
* **Biome:** The "Dry Vein" (Desert Canyon).  
* **The Node:** Water (Weak/Trickling).  
* **History:**  
  * **The Lost Bond:** They were once inextricably linked to the Air Clan. They lived *inside* the river walls, breathing via air bubbles provided by the Air Clan.  
  * **The Collapse:** When the Old Empire fell, the Air Clan retreated, the bubbles stopped, and the river dried up. The survivors were forced into the canyon floor.  
  * **Power Source:** They carry "Gems" that hold the residual environmental energy of their lost home.  
* **Natural Adaptation:** They have evolved to retain water like cacti. They wear "Still-Suits" made of organic leather to reclaim moisture.

**C. The Air Clan (The Renali)**

* **Status:** *Neutral / Elusive.*  
* **Biome:** The "Vapor Sea" (Floating Islands).  
* **The Node:** Wind/Gravity.  
* **Natural Adaptation:** They ride **Air-Bees** (Giant insects). They do not use engines; they use silk sails and insect pheromones to steer their islands.  
* **Secret Strength:** They are "accidentally strong" because their meandering path creates micro-connections with other distant Nodes, keeping their magic surprisingly potent.  
* **The "Bride Exchange" Ritual:**  
  * Strict orders are given: Do not see the ground, do not speak, do not merge crystals.  
  * Riders fly Air-Bees into the fog layer where visibility is zero.  
  * They drop a Clan member into the mist and blindly snatch a rope holding a person from a ground clan (or another island).  
  * This ensures genetic diversity without breaking their isolationist "flight" vow. The Air-Bees must *never* touch the ground.

**D. The Deep-Root Clan (The Mizizi) \[New Natural Concept\]**

* **Status:** *Unknown / Dormant.*  
* **Biome:** The "Petrified Forest" or "Fungal Deep."  
* **The Node:** Earth/Growth (Corrupted or Wild).  
* **Natural Adaptation:** They live inside the hollowed-out fossilized roots of ancient mega-flora. They use fungal spores for communication and defense. They are the "recyclers" of the world.

**V. Map Zones & Geography**

1. **The Vapor Sea:** The cloud layer separating the peaks. Requires airships or Air-Bees to cross.  
2. **The Dry Vein:** The desert canyon of the River Clan.  
3. **The Petrifaction Fields:** Where the Mizizi live. A forest turned to stone, now overgrown with massive fungi.  
4. **Tartannen:** The mythical "First City" of the old empire, rumored to be somewhere in this sector.

**VI. Player Hooks (The Intake)**

* **The Selection:** You are part of the massive intake. You are being tested not for your grades, but for your "Domain Resonance."  
* **The Stakes:** The Instructors are harsh. "Look to your left, look to your right. Both of them will likely be dismissed by noon."  
* **The Secret:** The Dean knows the power is failing. If this class doesn't find a strong Node, the lights at the Academy—and back home—will go out forever.

# Bestiary

# **📖 The Dual-Codex: Harmony vs. The Wilds**

**Concept:** The Academy views the frontier as a resource to be harvested. The Clans view it as a living entity to be negotiated with. **Mechanic:** Players can roll **Knowledge (Academic)** to get the Harmony entry, or **Knowledge (Culture/Nature)** to get the Clan entry. Usually, the Clan entry contains the *actual* solution to the encounter.

## **🐾 I. The Bestiary (Creatures of the Shattered Nodes)**

### **1\. The Ether-Jelly (Target of Prof. Ink)**

* **Visual:** A floating, translucent jellyfish the size of a cow, trailing neon-blue stingers that phase through solid matter.  
* **Harmony Classification:** *"Phase-Shift Cnidarian (Type 3 Pest)."*  
  * **The Science:** Non-sentient gas-bags. They clog intake valves and disrupt sonar. Protocol: Disperse with electric shock.  
* **Clan Lore (Trench-Kin / Iggy):** *"The Soul-Drifters."*  
  * **The Truth:** These are not animals; they are the memories of the land that has Dissolved. They are attracted to strong emotions.  
  * **Survival Tip:** Do not shock them; they explode into psychic static that wipes your memory. To move them, you must hum a low, sad tune. They will follow the vibration of grief.  
* **Recent Interaction:** Yesterday, a Copper-rank student tried to net one near the docks. He is now in the infirmary, physically fine, but he cannot remember his mother's name.

### **2\. The Void-Beast (Target of Cmdr. Blitz)**

* **Visual:** A sleek, six-legged predator made of shifting black smoke and obsidian teeth. It casts no shadow.  
* **Harmony Classification:** *"Aetheric Apex Predator (AAP)."*  
  * **The Science:** A carbon-based lifeform that hunts via thermal vision. Protocol: Overwhelming kinetic force and floodlights.  
* **Clan Lore (Ash-Blood / Ignatius):** *"Smoke-Stalkers."*  
  * **The Truth:** They do not hunt heat; they hunt *fear*. They are physical manifestations of the void trying to reclaim reality.  
  * **Survival Tip:** Running triggers their chase instinct. You must stand perfectly still and hold a "True Flame" (not Safe-Flame). They cannot cross a circle of real fire.  
* **Recent Interaction:** A patrol of "The Breakers" (Squad 02\) engaged a pack last night. They used floodlights. Two guards were dragged into the dark; their screams simply stopped instantly.

### **3\. The Rot-Shepherd (Mizizi Territory)**

* **Visual:** A hulking, shambling mound of compost, vines, and bones, shaped vaguely like a gorilla. It constantly sheds spores.  
* **Harmony Classification:** *"Parasitic Myco-Construct."*  
  * **The Science:** An animated accumulation of debris caused by wild spores. Invasive weed. Protocol: Incinerate immediately to prevent infection.  
* **Clan Lore (Mizizi / Britt & Aggie):** *" The Gardener."*  
  * **The Truth:** These are the immune system of the forest. They collect the dead to recycle them. They are peaceful unless you break a "Live Branch."  
  * **Survival Tip:** If you encounter one, bow and offer it "dead matter" (compost, old food, leather). It will trade you rare medicinal herbs for the "trash."  
* **Recent Interaction:** Dr. Rose Halloway (Squad 05\) burned a patch of "weeds" near the perimeter. A Rot-Shepherd retaliated by throwing a boulder through her lab window. Harmony calls it an "Unprovoked Attack."

### **4\. The Whispering Moth**

* **Visual:** A moth the size of a dinner plate with wings that look like blinking eyes.  
* **Harmony Classification:** *"Psionic Lepidoptera."*  
  * **The Science:** A hallucinogenic insect. Its dust causes temporary psychosis. Protocol: Wear filtration masks.  
* **Clan Lore (Universal):** *"The Liar-Bug."*  
  * **The Truth:** They mimic the voices of loved ones to lure travelers off cliffs.  
  * **Survival Tip:** If you hear your name called in the fog, cover your ears. If you answer, they steal your voice.  
* **Recent Interaction:** Lucky (Squad 09\) claims he heard his little sister calling from a ventilation shaft in the Deep-Hull. He was found clawing at a sealed grate, hallucinating that she was trapped inside.

## **📜 II. World Phenomena (The Physics of the Frontier)**

### **1\. "The Bleed" (Dissolution)**

* **Visual:** The edge of the map where the land turns into pixelated static and grey mist.  
* **Harmony View:** *"Dimensional Instability."*  
  * **Theory:** A lack of geometric scaffolding. The land is simply "falling off" the map.  
* **Clan View:** *"The Great Forgetting."*  
  * **Myth:** The world is a dream. When the dreamer wakes up, the edges fade.

### **2\. "The Minimum" (The Energy Crisis)**

* **Visual:** The flickering of the magitek lights; the groaning of the engines.  
* **Harmony View:** *"Temporary Efficiency Cycle."*  
  * **Propaganda:** We are re-routing power to the new expansion. It is a sign of growth\!  
* **Clan View:** *"Too Much Connection."*  
  * **Observation:** The City eats more than it bleeds. It is a parasite looking for a new host.  
  * **Secret Insight (Loami):** The boilers aren't just low on fuel; the *containment seals* are cracking. The city is trying to eat itself to stay alive.  
* **Recent Interaction:** The lights in the Copper Dorms (Block 99\) went out for 4 hours last night. Official reason: "Upgrades." Real reason: The Sky-Spire needed the juice for a dinner party.

### **3\. "Pre-Stitch" Artifacts (Ancient Tech)**

* **Visual:** Rusted, non-magical metal gears, combustion engines, and plastic found in the trash vortex.  
* **Harmony View:** *"Primitive Scrap."*  
  * **Theory:** Useless junk from civilizations that failed to achieve Harmony. Melt it down.  
* **Clan View (Earthkin/Mizizi):** *"The Old Iron."*  
  * **Myth:** Remnants of the "First Weavers" who built the world without magic.  
  * **Truth:** This tech doesn't require the Loom to function. It is immune to "The Minimum."  
* **Recent Interaction:** Old Man Silas found a "Combustion Generator" (a diesel engine). He got it running. It’s loud and smelly, but it *never flickers*. The Academy confiscated it as "Contraband."

## **🗝️ III. The Diplomatic "Truths"**

### **The Paper Men (The Envoys)**

* **Harmony History:** "Brave diplomats who peacefully negotiated the integration of the Clans."  
* **Clan History (Mizizi):** "Men in suits who smiled with their mouths but not their eyes. They signed the treaty in ink, but the paper smelled of ash."  
* **The Hook:** **Dean Vane** wears a ring identical to the one the Head Envoy wore when he burned the sacred grove to demonstrate "Safe-Flame."

### **The "Savant" Label**

* **Harmony Definition:** "A rare genetic anomaly allowing for high-performance magic."  
* **Clan Definition:** "Someone who hasn't been broken yet."  
* **The Hook:** The Academy treats Savants like prize racehorses. The Clans treat them like future martyrs.

### **The Exploranaut's Oath**

* **The Public Oath:** *"To seek the unknown and stitch it to the known."*  
* **The Whispered Oath (Among Veterans like Hesperus):** *"To survive the stupidity of command and bring the crew home."*

# Remnant Clans

# **Ancestral Knowledge & Academy Rumors**

*Confidential: Inherited beliefs based on Lineage in the era of "The Minimum".*

## **THE REMNANT CLANS (The Primal Elements)**

*Public Knowledge: There are FOUR known Remnant Clans: Ash-Bloods (New), Mizizi (New), Wadi (Dying), and Renali (First Contact era). Two others (Trench/Storm) are theoretically possible but currently unknown.*

### **5\. The Pyre-Keepers (Volcano Clan) [KNOWN / ACTIVE]**

* **The Element:** **MAGMA (Thermal Energy).**  
* **Rarity:** **Regional / Intense.**  
* **Node Intel:** **THE MAGMA HEART.**  
  * **The Physics:** The core heat of the planet. It creates land (rock) and destroys it.  
  * **The Value:** Industrial Heat. Harmony needs your temperatures to smelt their Iron and refine their Crystal. You are the "Kiln" of the empire.  
* **The Crisis:** **"The Cooling."**  
  * The vents are fading. The Elders fear the "Great Freeze" is coming.  
* **Ancestral Taboo:** **"The Obsidian Kiss."**  
  * *The Story:* A Fire-Prince once loved a River-Daughter. When they finally embraced, his heat met her water, and they instantly cooled into a single statue of screaming black glass. Mixing does not create life; it creates **Stasis**. Never touch the Water-Kin.  
* **View of the Academy:** **"The Great Furnace."**  
  * You were promised a city of eternal heat. You are disappointed to find it cold and sterile, but you stay because the "Crystal Batteries" feel like captured suns.  
* **First Contact Story:** **"The Beacon of Despair."**  
  * The Ash-Bloods realized their fires were dying. They deliberately created a massive smoke signal—a black pillar visible for miles—to *invite* Harmony. They traded their independence for heat.

    ### **6\. The Wadi (River Clan) [RARE / DECLINING]**

*Academy Status: Known but scarce. Their home node is fading, so few travel to the Academy.*

* **The Element:** **FRESH WATER (Hydrology).**  
* **Rarity:** **Scarce / Critical.**  
* **Node Intel:** **THE AQUIFER STONE.**  
  * **The Physics:** The solvent of life. It binds biological matter.  
  * **The Value:** Survival. You control a weak, trickling node, but because *everyone* needs water to live, you hold immense leverage. A cup of water in the desert is worth more than a ton of gold.  
* **The Crisis:** **"The Thirst."**  
  * The aquifers are empty. You lost your bond with the Air Clan long ago, and now you are dust-cacti people waiting for rain that never comes.  
* **Ancestral Taboo:** **"The Dry Grave."**  
  * *The Story:* A Water-Scout once fell asleep in a grove of the Root-Kin (Mizizi). The fungi did not attack him; they simply **drank**. He woke up as a desiccated husk, his moisture stolen to feed the rot. Never sleep near the green-bloods; they are always thirsty.  
* **View of the Academy:** **"The Iron Geyser."**  
  * You view the steam pipes and decorative fountains as a miracle and a sin. You are here to steal the secret of "Making Water" to save your canyon.  
* **First Contact Story:** **"The Stolen Water."**  
  * Strangers in metal suits walked into the Sacred Canyon. They carried canteens of sweet water but did not offer it. We thought they were mocking us. We took their moisture to survive. Then the "Paper-Man" (The Scrivener) came. He did not bring a weapon; he brought a contract. We signed it because he promised the water would flow again.

    ### **7\. The Renali (Air Clan) [RARE / REMOTE]**

*Academy Status: Known but elusive. They rarely land, making them a curiosity rather than a political force.*

* **The Element:** **WIND (Gas/Gravity).**  
* **Rarity:** **Abundant / Untamed.**  
* **Node Intel:** **THE SACRED WIND.**  
  * **The Physics:** Movement and mixture. Wind spreads seeds and regulates temperature.  
  * **The Value:** Transport. Harmony ships are heavy; they need your updrafts to save fuel. You control the "Highways" of the sky.  
* **The Crisis:** **"The Falling."**  
  * Your islands are drifting downward as gravity wins. The "Vapor Sea" is getting thinner.  
* **Ancestral Taboo:** **"The Heavy Heart."**  
  * *The Story:* A Rider who listened too long to the songs of the Volcano Clan found himself becoming "spiritually heavy." His Air-Bee refused to carry him. He didn't fall; he just sank. Never let the ground-dwellers anchor your mind.  
* **View of the Academy:** **"The Stone Cage."**  
  * It is heavy. It sits on the ground. It disgusts you. But you know the Academy has the "Lodestones" (Magnets) that could push your islands back up into the sky.  
* **First Contact Story:** **"The Caught Cloud."**  
  * The sky broke. A massive metal cloud (Harmony Airship) fell from the upper stream. It was heavy and dead, tumbling toward the ocean. We flew our Bees to catch it. We wove a net of silk and saved the metal-men. They were strange—they did not know how to fly, only how to burn fuel to fight gravity. We pity them.

    ### **8\. The Mizizi (Deep-Root Clan) [KNOWN]**

* **The Element:** **BIOMASS (Carbon/Life).**  
* **Rarity:** **Common / Overgrown.**  
* **Node Intel:** **THE SPORE-MOTHER.**  
  * **The Physics:** The cycle of decay and regrowth.  
  * **The Value:** Medicine and Food. The Academy eats synthetic sludge; you offer real caloric density and healing compounds. You are the "Farm" and the "Hospital."  
* **The Crisis:** **"The Corrupted Growth."**  
  * The Petrified Forest is ancient, but it has stopped *decaying*. It is a cancer of eternal growth. Without decay, there is no new life. The cycle has stalled.  
* **Ancestral Taboo:** **"The White Scorch."**  
  * *The Story:* A Circle once allowed a Fire-Kin to warm their grove during a freeze. They woke to find their Ancestral Rot turned to sterile white ash. There were no spores left to carry the memory. Fire is not an element; it is an eraser.  
* **View of the Academy:** **"The Sterile Field."**  
  * Everything here is polished brass and glass. Nothing rots. It is terrifyingly clean. You are here to find the "Rot" (the entropy) that makes life possible.  
* **First Contact Story:** **"The Quarantine Breach."**  
  * The "Iron-Worms" (Bulldozers) ate the edge of the forest to lay a rail line. They released the "Corrupted Growth," which began infecting the workers. The Mizizi emerged not to fight, but to *quarantine* the mess. They joined Harmony only because they lacked the fire/chemicals to prune the corruption themselves.

    ## **THE HIDDEN CLANS (The Extreme Elements)**

*Elements pushed to their physical limit.*

### **9\. The Trench-Kin (The Abyssal) [UNKNOWN / SECRET]**

*Academy Status: Completely unknown. Even the Faculty doesn't know.*

* **The Element:** **TECTONIC PRESSURE (Deep Earth).**  
* **Rarity:** **Inaccessible.**  
* **Node Intel:** **THE SLEEPING GOD.**  
  * **The Physics:** The weight of the world. It stabilizes the continental plates.  
  * **The Value:** Stability. Without this Node, the continents would drift too fast and tear the rail lines apart.  
* **The Crisis:** **"The Bends."**  
  * The pressure in your caves is dropping. Your eyes are bulging; their blood is boiling. The weight of the ocean is lifting, and it is killing them.  
* **Ancestral Taboo:** **"The Surface Burn."**  
  * The light above burns the eyes. You wear heavy, fluid-filled goggles when topside to survive the "Vacuum" of surface pressure.  
* **First Contact Story:** **"The Deafening Whale."**  
  * We have never seen a "Human." But last cycle, a **"Deafening Metal Whale"** (Submarine) passed through the water above our cave. It did not swim like a beast; it hummed with a rhythm that hurt our ears. It dropped a glowing metal egg (probe) near our entrance. We buried it in sand because the light hurt our eyes.

    ### **10\. The Fulgur-Born (The Storm-Chasers) [RUMORED / ANOMALY]**

*Academy Status: Treated as a singular anomaly (Zephyr).*

* **The Element:** **PLASMA (Lightning).**  
* **Rarity:** **Volatile / Fleeting.**  
* **Node Intel:** **THE JUDGMENT SEAT.**  
  * **The Physics:** Pure, unshielded energy discharge.  
  * **The Value:** The "Jump Start." This Node is too dangerous to use for steady power, but it can kick-start a dead engine or overcharge a weapon in an emergency.  
* **The Crisis:** **"The Silence."**  
  * The storm is quieting. The lightning strikes are becoming infrequent. Without the strikes, your energy-based biology is starving.  
* **Ancestral Taboo:** **"The Grounding."**  
  * You never stand still. To stop moving is to lose your charge. You are constantly vibrating or pacing. Stasis is death.  
* **First Contact Story:** **"The Slow Walker."**  
  * A **"Slow-Walker"** (Vanguard Runner) entered the Glass Desert. He moved clumsily, dragging a metal sled. He had no charge—he was dim. We skated to him to share the Spark, to "Judge" him. But he screamed and fired a weapon that threw a net. He fled before we could bless him with voltage. We learned that the Slow Ones fear the blessing.  
  * 

# Shattered Clans Lately

# **📜 The Diplomatic Dossier: State of the Frontier**

**Current Status:** Integration Phase (Year 2\) **Tension Level:** High / Philosophical Schism

## **🔗 The Exchange: The Ritual of Separation**

For centuries, the Clans have remained isolated to prevent "The Shattering," but they recognized the need for genetic and cultural variance.

* **The Mechanism:** Every 5 years, the Clans meet at a neutral "Hollow Point" to exchange eligible adults in a marriage/integration ceremony.  
* **The Selection:** Only the most diligent, mature, and disciplined members are selected. They are vetted to ensure they have the willpower to keep the **Great Taboo**: Never speak of your home again.  
* **The Blind Journey:** To ensure isolation, the Clans maintain **no maps**. Only the Elders know the location and timing of the Exchange. The young are **blindfolded** from the moment they leave their village until they arrive at the Hollow Point, and again until they reach their new home. They literally do not know the path back.  
* **The Taboo:** Once exchanged, a member is considered **Dead** to their old clan. They are forbidden from speaking of their home traditions. To speak of the past is to invite the "Curiosity" that destroys worlds.  
* **The Exception (The Cloud-Kin):** The Storm Chasers (Fulgor-Born) are the only clan exempt from the blindness. They must move constantly to stay alive within the jet streams. Though they keep no physical maps, they cannot help but learn the land from above, witnessing the ruins of the empire they left behind. This makes them the most dangerous—and knowledgeable—of all the clans.  
* **The Current Cycle:** The last Exchange happened roughly 18 months ago, coinciding with Harmony's arrival. This means there is only **one** truly "new" exchange member (Zephyr) navigating this dual shock.

## **🍄 I. The Mizizi (The Root-Kin)**

### **🏚️ The Tragedy: "The Burning Library"**

* **The Old Belief:** "When things stop dying, we start dying." The Mizizi believed they were trapped in a cycle of stagnation. They welcomed Harmony’s tools (solvents and shredders) to mulch the petrified forest, believing they were creating fertile soil for new life.  
* **The Horrifying Revelation:** **Senior Historian Nadine** and **Exploranaut Mosi** (the first Mizizi graduate) have discovered a terrifying truth in the lab. The petrified trees aren't just wood; they are **Data-Hardrives**.  
  * **The True History:** The Mizizi were not gardeners; they were the **Archivists of the Shattered Empire**. They were designed to be ever-living record keepers. The "Petrification" was a preservation method to save knowledge for the future.  
  * **The Interaction Protocol (The Tether):** Mizizi lore dictates they never connect to the Great Mother (the forest) alone. It is too vast. Prolonged connection causes "Strange Visions" (the Library attempting a data-dump).  
    * **The Method:** They work in pairs. One "Travels the Roots" (connects), and one "Anchors" (watches and pulls them back). They focus on each other to avoid being swept away by the archives.  
  * **The State of the Archive:** The library has been decaying for generations. The "New Growth" (non-decaying petrification) represents net-new storage or hardy fragments of the original Imperial Archive.  
  * **The Pruning (The Great Loss):** Tradition dictated pruning from **Oldest to Youngest**.  
    * **The Consequence:** They have been systematically deleting the ancient "Golden Age" history first.  
    * **The Remnant:** All that remains on the surface layers are the most recent recordings—tales of the Collapse, loss, and horror. These stories act as a terrifying "Gate," discouraging deep dives and reinforcing the belief that the past is pain. By destroying the deep roots, they are erasing the only proof that life was ever better.  
* **Harmony’s Stance:** "Stop the Mulch\!" Harmony is now desperately trying to convince the Mizizi Elders to *stop* destroying the trees. They want to preserve the history.  
* **Mizizi Elders’ Stance:** "You promised us new life\!" They feel betrayed. They think Harmony wants to keep them trapped in the "Dead Stone" past instead of letting them grow.

### **👥 The "Foreign" Integers (Exchange Members)**

The Mizizi still participate in The Exchange, but their recent adoptees are reacting to Harmony in very different ways.

* **Zephyr (The Storm Voice):**  
  * **Origin:** **The Cloud-Kin (Storm Chasers).**  
  * **Public Status:** **"Foreign Dignitary" / Classified.**  
  * **The Outlier:** She arrived in the last exchange (18 months ago). Unlike the disciplined envoys of the past, the Storm-Kin are naturally wild and fearless. Most students assume she is an eccentric **Renali (Air Clan)** pilot, unaware she represents a completely different storm-based faction to the north. Only the Dean knows her true origin.  
  * **The Breach:** Zephyr breaks the Taboo not out of malice, but out of sheer, uncontainable excitement. She doesn't fear "The Shattering." She speaks openly of the "High-Jet Streams" and the "Thunder-Node."  
  * **Academy Relation:** Dean Vane has personally invited Zephyr into the inner circle. There are no spies here; the Dean and Zephyr can be found late at night in the Sky-Spire, eating sunflower seeds and frantically sketching wind-patterns on a chalkboard. Vane believes Zephyr holds the key to high-altitude flight.  
* **Rill (The River-Born):**  
  * **Origin:** **The Wadi (River Clan).**  
  * **Public Status:** **Mizizi Researcher.**  
  * **The Dilemma:** She arrived 6 years ago (previous cycle). She is deeply disciplined. While she doesn't hide her Wadi heritage, she focuses entirely on her work, making her seem like just another scholar.  
  * **The Conflict:** Her home Node is dying—a river reduced to a trickle. Her people sacrifice their own rainwater to feed the Node rather than drink it themselves. To see the Mizizi deliberately destroying their own "clan-blood" (the Forest) breaks her heart.  
  * **The Ruse:** She came to Vumbua last year claiming she wanted to study "Accelerated Decay" to help the Mizizi destroy the forest faster.  
  * **The Reality:** She is secretly researching to see if the forest *needs* to be destroyed at all. She is on the verge of a eureka moment regarding the forest's true nature, but she cannot act alone. She needs to find a Mizizi clan member to bring into the great discovery she has made.

### **🏛️ The Representatives**

* **Exploranaut Mosi (Council Member):** He is currently in a panic. He spends his days decoding the "Tree-Rings" of the logs scheduled for the furnace, trying to save fragments of history before they are burned. He is the bridge between Nadine's theory and his people's survival instinct.  
* **Kojo (Silver Student):** He works the Help Desk, trying to translate this new reality to incoming students. "We are not just roots," he tells them. "We are the scroll *and* the ink."

## **🔥 II. The Ash-Bloods (The Ember-Kin)**

### **🌋 The Resurgence: "The Conductive Theory"**

* **The Old Belief:** "The Cold Shoulder." Ash-blood history warns that outsiders are "Heat-Sinks"—parasites that steal warmth until the Obsidian turns grey and brittle. This is why they hid behind the Smoke Curtain.  
* **The Harmony Proof:** Since the Academy anchored near the ridge, the Obsidian Skin of the youth isn't fading—it is **brightening**.  
* **The Physics:** Harmony engineers proved that Ash-blood heat is exponentially amplified when in proximity to other active Nodes. They aren't batteries being drained; they are **Resonance Chambers** being rung.  
* **The Conflict:** The Elders remember the "Cold Times" and refuse to believe the data. The Youth (like Ignatius) feel the surge of power and want to rush toward the center of the city, terrifying their parents who think they will burn out.

### **💔 The Broken Exchange**

* **The Event:** This year, the Ash-Bloods were scheduled to send a bride to the **Trench-Kin**.  
* **The Decision:** They didn't show up. With their volcanoes reignited by Harmony, they no longer feel the need to trade for "New Blood" to survive. They believe they have ascended beyond the old ways.  
* **The Insult:** Instead of a person, they dropped a **Obsidian Tablet** down the exchange shaft. It read: *"The Heat has returned. We need nothing from the Dark. Look to the Light."*

### **⚖️ The Trade Agreement (The Boiler Room Pact)**

* **Status:** Enthusiastic Partnership (among the youth).  
* **The Reality:** Ash-bloods aren't forced into the boilers; they beg for the shifts. The Boiler Room is the only place in Vumbua hot enough to feel like "Home" without the stifling containment suits.  
* **The Innovation:** Rather than using generic "Potential Energy" cores, Harmony has retrofitted the entire port engine to run on **Direct Obsidian Transfer**. It is 300% more efficient, and the Ash-bloods take immense pride in being the literal heartbeat of the city.

### **🏛️ The Representatives**

* **Lady Ignis:** She is not a hostage; she has traveled to **Harmony Seat** to join the High Council as the Representative of the Clans.  
  * **The Power:** In accordance with Harmony's "Inverse Power Doctrine" (the belief that the newest among them should hold the most power), she was granted tremendous voting weight. She instantly became one of the most important figures in the land, creating laws for a society she barely understands but holding massive sway over new Frontier charters.  
  * **The Act:** It was *her* signature on the "Expansion Bill" that authorized the relocation of Vumbua Academy to the Ash-blood Isles.  
  * **The Retinue:** She attempted to bring the Mizizi Elders to the capital, but they refused. Instead, she traveled with the majority of the Ash-blood Elders (those fit for travel) and was escorted by **Captain Elara Thorne** (the exploranaut who first contacted her people), who has only just returned to Vumbua to assist with the intake.  
  * **The Belief:** She believes that political integration at the highest level is the only way to ensure her people are partners, not fuel.

## **🕳️ III. The Earthkin / Trench-Kin (The Deep Dwellers)**

### **🤝 The Discovery: Iggy's Secret**

* **The Cover-Up:** When the Ash-Bloods dropped the Obsidian Tablet ("Look to the Light"), the Trench-Kin Elders were terrified. They buried the tablet, fearing that curiosity about the "Light" would destroy their society.  
* **Iggy's Origin:** **Iggy** was a deep-tunnel scrapper who found the buried tablet. He didn't read it as an insult; he read it as an invitation.  
* **The Motivation:** He isn't on the surface to conquer; he is here to find out why the Ash-Bloods stopped coming. He suspects the surface isn't a "Burning Hellscape" (as the Elders teach) but a place of infinite energy.

### **🏛️ The Representatives**

* **Status:** **HIDDEN / UNCONTACTED.** Harmony has no official contact with the Trench-Kin. The Academy believes the deep crust is composed of lifeless rock and pressurized gas pockets. They have no idea a civilization exists below.  
* **Iggy (Gold):** He is not a diplomat; he is an **Unregistered Infiltrator**. He passed the entrance exams by simply not listing a home address and letting the registrars assume he was a generic "Earth-Elemental" construct or mutation. He represents the potential of a people who have not yet introduced themselves.

## **🔍 IV. The Shattered Empire Theory (The Research)**

**The Project:** "The Unification Hypothesis" **Lead Researchers:** **Dean Isolde Vane** (The Architect) & **Senior Historian Nadine** (The Theorist).

* **The Theory:** The Clans (Mizizi, Ash-blood, Trench-kin, and the rumored Cloud-kin) are not separate species. They are **specialized castes** of a single, global civilization that shattered 10,000 years ago.  
  * **Mizizi:** The Archivists (Memory).  
  * **Ash-bloods:** The Engines (Power).  
  * **Trench-kin:** The Miners (Resources).  
  * **Cloud-Kin:** The Architects (Vision).  
  * **Harmony:** The Navigators (Direction).  
* **The Implication:** They were *designed* to function together. The "Disaster" the clans fear wasn't caused by proximity; it was caused by **separation**. The machine broke, and the parts drifted away.  
* **The Goal:** To prove to the isolationist Elders that "The Great Stitching" isn't a new empire conquering them—it is a **Repair Mission**.

## **🔬 V. Dean Isolde Vane (The Heimerdinger Archetype)**

* **Vibe:** A small, bustling ball of intellect and empathy. Think Heimerdinger (Arcane). She is brilliant, scattered, and deeply caring.  
* **The Office:** A chaos of floating chalkboards, half-finished prototypes, and cups of cold tea.  
* **The Motivation:** She isn't a politician; she is a problem solver. She views the Clans not as "subjects" but as "lost family members."  
* **Relationship with Zephyr:** She is fascinated by Zephyr. She treats her like a granddaughter and a fellow scholar, spending hours asking about wind currents. There is no manipulation here—just pure, unadulterated scientific joy.  
* **Quote:** *"Don't you see, Mosi? The Ash-bloods are the fuel, the Mizizi are the memory, and we are the steering wheel\! We aren't building a city—we're putting the giant back together\!"*

# Lore Update

# **📖 The Vumbua World Bible**

**Setting:** A "Magitek-Steampunk" reality defined by The Great Stitching. **Aesthetic:** 1920s Oxford meets *Treasure Planet*. Brass, teal energy, stone masonry, and modular construction.

## **🏗️ I. The Architecture of the Academy**

Vumbua is not a vehicle; it is a **Mobile Modular City**.

### **The 30/70 Rule**

* **The Cores (30%):** These are the only permanent, moving structures. They teleport/fly to new frontiers and act as the anchors.  
  * **The Sky-Spire:** A vertical, golden airship (Command, Elite Dorms, Navigation).  
  * **The Deep-Hull:** A massive iron steamship (Classrooms, Logistics, Mess Halls).  
  * **The Walker-Core:** A four-legged industrial power unit \- on the edge of the proper grounds, It and the ship can transport each other (slowly) (Engineering, Power, The Loom).  
* **The Spire-Scape (70%):** Upon landing, thousands of "Worker-Constructs" swarm out to assemble a temporary city around the Cores.  
  * **Visuals:** A forest of scaffolding, steam cranes lifting prefab dorms, and ley-lines being laid directly into the dirt. It feels like a high-tech refugee camp mixed with a World's Fair.

## **🔮 II. Magic & Technology ("Harmony")**

### **Geometric vs. Wild Magic**

* **Harmony (Geometric):** The Academy’s magic is rigid, formulaic, and "Safe." It uses tuning forks, crystals, and math to impose order on chaos.  
  * *Visual:* Teal, steady, geometric shapes. Quiet hums.  
  * *Example:* **"Safe-Flame"** (Chemically stabilized fire that provides heat without burning wood).  
* **Variance (Wild):** The magic of the Clans (Ash-blood, Mizizi, Earthkin). It is raw, emotional, and unpredictable.  
  * *Visual:* Orange/Green/Brown, flickering, organic shapes. Crackling or singing sounds.  
  * *Example:* **"True Spark"** (Ignatius’s fire that consumes oxygen and casts dancing shadows).

### **The "Loom" & Bureaucracy**

* **The Loom:** A massive crystal computer in the Walker-Core. It calculates probabilities and assigns ranks.  
* **The Receipt:** The *only* official proof of status. A narrow strip of parchment printed by 1920s-style typewriters. Without a receipt, you are a non-entity.  
* **Resource Currency:** "Charge" or "Battery Hours." Gold is decorative; energy is survival.

## **📜 III. History & Politics**

### **The "Silent Era" (80 Years Ago \- Present)**

* **The Drought:** For eight decades, no new Nodes were found. Maps remained static. The culture of exploration stagnated into academic theory.  
* **The Consequence:** "Exploranauts" became celebrities/myths rather than active agents. The Academy became stuffy and elitist.  
* **The Awakening:** The discovery of the new Terra (Mizizi/Ash-blood lands) has shattered the silence. The city is in a "Gold Rush" frenzy.

### **The "Minimum" (State Secret)**

* **The Truth:** Harmony is running out of power. The "Silent Era" drained the batteries.  
* **The Lie:** The Dean claims the new expansion is for "Glory" and "Destiny."  
* **The Stakes:** If the Venture fails, the Academy cannot travel back. They will be stranded without enough power to travel Vumbuas cores. 

## **🌿 IV. The Integrated Clans**

### **The Mizizi (The Root-Kin)**

* **Origin:** The Petrified Forest (Deep Frontier).  
* **The Hook:** Their Node contains a resonance that **halts decay**.  
* **Academy View:** "A medical miracle waiting to be harvested."  
* **Clan View:** "When things stop dying, we start dying." (They need the cycle of rot to survive).  
* **Stereotype:** Slow, fungal, weird. "Gardeners."

### **The Ash-Bloods (The Ember-Kin)**

* **Origin:** The Volcanic Ridges.  
* **The Hook:** Their Node pulses with **Primal Heat** (infinite geothermal energy).  
* **Academy View:** "A new battery for the forges."  
* **Clan View:** Fire is a living ancestor, not a fuel source.  
* **Stereotype:** Volatile, dangerous, "Savages" who refuse to use Safe-Flame.

## **⚔️ V. Hierarchy & The "Rust" Reality**

### **The Ranks**

1. **Gold (Aurum):** The Aristocracy. 1% of students. Too expensive to fail (demoted to Copper, never Rust).  
2. **Silver (Argent):** The Professionals. 24% of students. The actual workforce.  
3. **Copper (Aes):** The Bulk. 55% of students. Laborers and grunts.  
4. **Rust (Ferrum):** The Culled. 20% of students.  
   * *Fate:* They are stripped of their receipts and reassigned to "City Maintenance" (sewers, scrap-haulers) or **Squad 09** (Trap Detection). They are effectively non-citizens.

### **The "Savant" Loophole**

The Loom is programmed to identify **"High-Variance"** (Outliers).

* A Copper/Silver student who solves a problem using "Wild Magic" (unsanctioned methods) can trigger a "Savant" flag.  
* *Risk:* High. It can lead to promotion (Gold) or branding as a Heretic (Expulsion).

# Integration

# **⏳ The Vumbua Timeline: 3,000 Years of The Stitching**

**Core Philosophy:** "We do not conquer land; we wake it up." **The Mechanic of Integration:** Symbiotic Resonance.

## **⚡ Part I: The Mechanics of Integration (How it Works)**

Every Node is a dormant battery of a specific type of reality (Heat, Growth, Light, Gravity).

* **The Dormant State:** Isolated Nodes are weak. Their power is local and inefficient (e.g., Ash-blood lava only heats the mountain; Mizizi forests grow slowly).  
* **The Spark (Symbiosis):** Integration requires a **Two-Way Flow**.  
  1. **Inward Flow:** The raw material of the new Node (Obsidian) is used to power Harmony tech (Boilers) at 100% efficiency.  
  2. **Outward Flow:** Harmony's "General Battery" (Geometric Potential) is used in the new territory to power a local function (a camp stove) at lower efficiency.  
* **The "Click":** When both flows happen simultaneously, the realities lock together. The new land physically lurches toward Harmony. The power amplifies exponentially.

### **🚫 The Mizizi Failure (Why they aren't integrated)**

* **The Block:** Harmony has failed to establish the **Outward Flow**.  
  * They tried to bring "New Life" (Solvents/Fertilizer), but the Forest rejected it as poison.  
  * **The Missing Key:** Harmony has not yet brought **"Stored Knowledge"** (Books/Data) into the forest.  
  * **The Theory:** The Mizizi Node is "The Memory." It doesn't eat fertilizer; it eats *history*. Until Harmony physically carts their Archives into the Petrified Forest, the circuit will remain open, and the Mizizi will remain "Diluted."  
  * **The Reciprocal Lock:** Additionally, the connection remains blocked until Mizizi bark is used to create paper—transforming their physical form into a vessel for knowledge—within the proximity of an integrated Core (which the Ash-blood Volcanoes now count as).

## **📜 Part II: The Historical Timeline**

### **Era 1: The First Spark (3,000 Years Ago)**

* **The Event:** Two primitive tribes—**The Weavers** (Constructors) and **The Navigators** (Star-Readers)—meet on a dying shard of reality.  
* **The First Stitch:** Instead of fighting for the last scraps of food, a Weaver uses a Navigator's star-chart to power a loom. The realities fuse. The land stabilizes.  
* **The Result:** The founding of **Harmony Prime**. The first city is born.

### **Era 2: The Resource Wars (2,500 \- 1,500 Years Ago)**

* **The Conflict:** As Harmony expanded, they encountered **The Iron-Clad** (Metal-Kin) and **The Tide-Callers** (Water-Kin).  
* **The War:** Harmony tried to *conquer* the Nodes instead of harmonizing them.  
* **The Consequence:** The "Dissolved Lands." Entire continents shattered because the energy flow was one-way (extraction only).  
* **The Lesson:** "You cannot steal a Node; you must marry it."

### **Era 3: The Golden Stitch (1,500 \- 1,000 Years Ago)**

* **The Peace:** Harmony adopts the "Inverse Power Doctrine." The newest/weakest members are given the most political power to ensure fair Symbiosis.  
* **The Expansion:** A massive boom. The Wind-Kin, the Glass-Walkers, and the Crystal-Singers are integrated. Harmony becomes a continent.  
* **The Tech:** The first "Teleporting City" (Vumbua) is built to hunt for distant Nodes.

### **Era 4: The Long Lull (1,000 Years Ago \- 80 Years Ago)**

* **The Stagnation:** New Nodes become harder to find. The distances grow vast.  
* **The Shift:** Vumbua becomes an academic institution rather than an explorer's guild. "Exploranaut" becomes a title for historians, not adventurers.  
* **The Decay:** Without new Resonance, the batteries slowly begin to drain. The edges of Harmony start to fray (The Bleed).

### **Era 5: The Silent Era (80 Years Ago \- Present)**

* **The Drought:** Not a single Node is found for three generations.  
* **The Crisis:** "The Minimum." The lights flicker. The Council panics but keeps it secret.  
* **The Discovery (2 Years Ago):** A desperate deep-scan reveals two faint pulses in the "Shattered Sector"—The Ash-bloods (Heat) and the Mizizi (Memory).  
* **The Rush:** Vumbua teleports for the first time in a century.

## **🌍 Part III: The "Shattered Node" Ecology**

Every Node creates a unique civilization (Biome) around it. It isn't always human.

### **1\. The Obsidian Ridges (Ash-Blood)**

* **The Biome:** Volcanic glass and magma.  
* **The Civ:** Humanoid/Elemental hybrids.  
* **Integration Status:** **100%.**  
  * *Inward:* Obsidian powers the Boilers.  
  * *Outward:* Harmony batteries power their cooling suits.  
  * *Result:* The volcanoes are roaring. The Ash-bloods are thriving.

### **2\. The Petrified Forest (Mizizi)**

* **The Biome:** Massive, stone-flesh trees that "breathe" dust.  
* **The Civ:** Fungal-Turtle hybrids (Mizizi).  
* **Integration Status:** **15% (Stalled).**  
  * *Inward:* Soil powers the Hydroponics (Weak connection).  
  * *Outward:* Harmony Solvents kill the trees (Rejection).  
  * *Result:* The forest is dying, but the Node isn't waking up.

### **3\. The Abyssal Trench (Trench-Kin)**

* **The Biome:** High-pressure underwater vents.  
* **The Civ:** Earth/Crab hybrids.  
* **Integration Status:** **0% (Hidden).**  
  * *Potential:* Harmony pumps could aerate their water; Trench-crystals could harden Harmony hulls.

### **4\. The Cloud-Vaults (Storm Chasers)**

* **The Biome:** Solidified lightning clouds in the jet stream.  
* **The Civ:** Avian/Energy beings (Rumored).  
* **Integration Status:** **Unknown.**  
  * *Potential:* Infinite electrical power vs. Weather control tech.

# Harmony Factions

# **🏛️ The Harmony Factions: Pillars of the Empire**

**Context:** The Empire of Harmony is governed by families who control specific elemental physics. **The Political Divide:**

* **The Venture Council (The Core Four):** The expeditionary forces running Vumbua Academy. They are focused on **Exploration & Survival**.  
* **The Domestic Council (The Civilian Pillars):** The powers running the static capital, Harmony Prime. They are focused on **Stability & Exploitation**.

## **🚀 I. The Venture Pillars (The Core Four)**

*These factions dominate the Academy. They are the "Flight Crew" of the mobile city.*

### **💎 1\. House Gilded (The Highborne)**

* **Sphere:** Capital, Energy Storage, Investment.  
* **The Element:** **PURE CRYSTAL (The Battery).**  
* **Philosophy:** *"Assimilation is Profit."*  
* **History:** Rose to power in **Era 1** by perfecting the storage of raw magic, allowing civilization to exist at night.  
* **The "Minimum" Motive:** The Crystal Banks are insolvent. They need the **"Great Surge"** (500 years of power) not just to keep the lights on, but to hide the fact that they leveraged the empire's future on bad energy bets during the Silent Era.  
* **Key NPCs:**  
  * **Valerius Sterling (Captain/Student):** Represents the arrogant youth who believes the world owes him a legacy.  
  * **Lady Vespera (Captain):** Represents the ruthlessness of Highborne trade.

### **🛡️ 2\. The Vane Lineage (The Orderborne)**

* **Sphere:** Defense, Walls, Reality Anchors.  
* **The Element:** **COLD IRON (Magnetism).**  
* **Philosophy:** *"Defense is Survival."*  
* **History:** Gained dominance during the **Resource Wars (Era 2\)** when the borders destabilized. They built the walls that kept the monsters out.  
* **The "Minimum" Motive:** They know the "Perimeter" is failing. The Ether Beasts are evolving. They view the "Shattered Circuit" not as a puzzle, but as a breach in the wall. They want to **force** the circuit closed to re-arm the shields.  
* **Key NPCs:**  
  * **Lord Commander Titus Vane:** The militant rival to the Dean. He believes the Academy is too soft and scientific. He pushes for aggressive exploration ("Find and Secure") rather than empathetic understanding. He views the Clans as strategic assets to be conscripted.  
  * **Celia Vance (Proctor):** The rigid enforcer of safety protocols.  
  * **Kaelo "Ghost" Vane (Captain):** The black-ops wing of the family.

### **📜 3\. The Scrivener Guild (The Loreborne)**

* **Sphere:** Navigation, Maps, Data, History.  
* **The Element:** **AETHER (Data/Echoes).**  
* **Philosophy:** *"Discovery is Truth."*  
* **History:** Descendants of the original **Navigators** (Era 1). They decoded the laws of "Symbiotic Resonance" in **Era 3**.  
* **The "Minimum" Motive:** They are the keepers of the **"Dark Ages" Secret**. They know the Empire collapsed once before due to isolation. They are terrified that the Mizizi are burning the archives because the Mizizi trees contain the *only* record of exactly *how* the previous collapse happened.  
* **Key NPCs:**  
  * **Dean Isolde (The Architect):** The Head of the Academy. A brilliant, Heimerdinger-esque savant who views the Stitching as a complex equation of empathy and physics. She is desperate to solve the puzzle before the lights go out, but refuses to use the brute force methods of the Vanes.  
  * **Professor Ink (Captain):** Represents the pure thirst for knowledge.  
  * **Senior Historian Nadine:** Working with the Dean to prove the "Shattered Empire" theory.

### **⚙️ 4\. The Iron-Union (The Ridgeborne)**

* **Sphere:** Engines, Labor, Industry, Heat.  
* **The Element:** **STEAM (Pressure/Force).**  
* **Philosophy:** *"Stabilization is Duty."*  
* **History:** Split from the original **Weavers** in **Era 2**. While the Architects focused on static stone, the Union focused on *machines*. They are the Blue-Collar nobility.  
* **The "Minimum" Motive:** They are the only ones who physically feel the "Ghost Charge." They are pushing hardest for **Ash-blood Integration** because the Obsidian direct-transfer is the only thing keeping the boilers from exploding.  
* **Key NPCs:**  
  * **Loami (PC):** The prodigy mechanic.  
  * **"Old Man" Silas (Captain):** The cynical veteran who knows where the bodies are buried.  
  * **"Hammer" (Squad 05 Leader):** The ambitious climber.

## **🏛️ II. The Civilian Pillars (The Domestic Auditors)**

*These factions have just arrived in Vumbua's wake. They view the Academy as a reckless expense and want to strip-mine the frontier.*

### **🌾 5\. The Verdant Trust (The Agri-Lords)**

* **Sphere:** Agriculture, Food, Biology.  
* **The Element:** **HUMUS (Carbon/Growth).**  
* **Philosophy:** *"Growth is Mandatory."*  
* **The Crisis:** The topsoil in Harmony Prime is dead. The Empire is 6 months away from famine.  
* **Agenda in Vumbua:** They want to seize the **Mizizi Forest**. They don't care about the "Memory Node" or the history; they see millions of tons of fertile compost. They are lobbying to **mulch the entire forest** immediately to send fertilizer back home.  
* **Conflict:** They are the natural enemies of the Mizizi and the Scriveners (who want to save the trees).  
* **Key Agent:** **Overseer Grimaldi.** A massive man in a green velvet suit offering huge bounties for "Life-Soil."

### **⚖️ 6\. The High-Justiciars (The Scales)**

* **Sphere:** Law, Contracts, Political Balance.  
* **The Element:** **LEAD (Weight/Finality).**  
* **Philosophy:** *"The Balance Must Hold."*  
* **History:** Formed in **Era 3** to enforce the "Inverse Power Doctrine." They ensure new Nodes get political power to prevent the Core Families from becoming tyrants.  
* **Agenda in Vumbua:** **The Audit.** They believe Dean Vane is cooking the books regarding the energy output. They are investigating why the Ash-blood and Mizizi nodes are under-performing (The Shattered Circuit leak). They threaten to shut down the Academy if the numbers don't balance.  
* **Key Agent:** **Adjudicator Kael.** A woman in a lead-lined coat who follows Dean Vane's staff, demanding un-redacted logs.

### **🧱 7\. The Grand Architects (House Mason)**

* **Sphere:** Construction, Cities, Housing.  
* **The Element:** **GRANITE (Permanence).**  
* **Philosophy:** *"Stone Remembers."*  
* **History:** The other half of the original **Weavers**. They despise the Iron-Union's "temporary" metal machines. They build for eternity.  
* **Agenda in Vumbua:** They hate the "Modular City" aesthetic of Vumbua. They want to pave the Ash-blood Isles and build a static stone fortress. They are trying to evict the Mizizi from their "unsafe" cliffside dorms.  
* **Key Agent:** **Architect Stone.** A dwarf with geomantic granite hands who is trying to condemn Block 04-Root.

### **⚓ 8\. The Syndicate of Sails (The Logistics)**

* **Sphere:** Trade, Transport, Currency Flow.  
* **The Element:** **MERCURY (Fluidity).**  
* **Philosophy:** *"Momentum is Value."*  
* **History:** Privatized Quartermasters from the Silent Era. They control the flow of goods between Nodes.  
* **Agenda in Vumbua:** **Monopoly.** They know the **Storm Chasers (Cloud-Kin)** control the jet streams. They want to find them *first* to secure exclusive trade rights to the high-altitude routes.  
* **Key Agent:** **Broker Silas.** A slick fixer in the Celestial Lounge trying to buy the loyalty of Rust-tier students (like Lucky) to map the black market routes.

# Harmony Timeline

# **⏳ The Vumbua Timeline: 3,000 Years of Harmony**

**Core Philosophy:** "Unity is Physics." **The Mechanic:** The Great Stitching is not magic; it is a circuit.

## **⚡ Part I: The Mechanics of Integration (Symbiotic Resonance)**

Integration is the process of locking two disparate realities into a single flow. It requires a simultaneous, two-way energy exchange.

### **1\. The Inward Flow (The Raw to the Refined)**

* **Action:** The raw material of the new Node must be used to power an integrated technology at **100% efficiency** within the radius of an already Integrated Core.  
* **Example (Ash-Bloods):** Raw Obsidian taken from the ridge is placed into a Harmony Boiler. It burns hotter than coal. The energy creates a "Tether" back to the source.

### **2\. The Outward Flow (The Refined to the Raw)**

* **Action:** A Harmony "Battery" (Geometric Potential) must be used within the territory of the new Node to power a local necessity, proving that Harmony sustains the new land.  
* **Example (Ash-Bloods):** A Harmony battery is used to power a cook-stove or cooling suit inside the volcano. The local reality accepts the foreign energy.

### **3\. The Lock (The Stitch)**

* When both flows occur, the "Safe Lane" opens. The Aether-beasts are pushed back by the resonance, creating a stable travel corridor. The Nodes pull toward each other ever so slowly (hundreds of years to move a mile)

### **🚫 The Mizizi Blockage (The Current Puzzle)**

The Mizizi are stalled because the circuit is incomplete. The purpose of the forest is not yet understood making it impossible to perform the integration

* **Inward Failure:** Harmony has not yet taken Mizizi Bark, turned it into paper, and filled it with knowledge near an Integrated Core (The Ash-Blood Volcanoes).  
* **Outward Failure:** Harmony tried to bring "Fertilizer" (Growth) to the forest. But the Mizizi Node is **Memory**, not Biology. To create the Outward Flow, Harmony must cart **Stored Knowledge** (Books/Archives) into the forest to "feed" the trees.

## **📜 Part II: The Harmony History (3,000 \- 1,000 Years Ago)**

### **Era 1: The First Spark (3,000 Years Ago)**

* **The Origin:** Two warring tribes—**The Weavers** (Constructors) and **The Navigators** (Star-Readers)—met on a dying shard of reality surrounded by Aether Beasts.  
* **The Unification:** Instead of fighting, a Weaver used a Navigator's star-chart to power a loom. The realities fused. **Harmony Prime** was born.  
* **The Core Families Emerge:**  
  * **House Gilded** perfected the Crystal Battery to store the spark.  
  * **The Iron-Union** built the engines to utilize it.

### **Era 2: The Resource Wars (2,500 \- 1,500 Years Ago)**

* **The Conflict:** Harmony expanded aggressively. They tried to extract resources without completing the "Outward Flow."  
* **The Consequence:** The **Vane Lineage** (Defenders) rose to power during this era, building the walls to keep the Aether Beasts out as the borders destabilized.  
* **The Lesson:** "One-way flow leads to Dissolution."

### **Era 3: The Golden Stitch (1,500 \- 1,000 Years Ago)**

* **The Discovery:** The **Scrivener Guild** decoded the "Symbiotic Resonance" laws.  
* **The Boom:** A golden age of integration. Several "Great Nodes" (sentient civilizations) were found and stitched. The continent grew massive.  
* **The Peace:** For a millennium, there was no major war. Just quiet periods of consolidation followed by the excitement of a new Stitch.

## **🌊 Part III: The Long Silence (1,000 Years Ago \- Present)**

### **Era 4: The Dwindling (1,000 \- 80 Years Ago)**

* **The Shift:** The Great Nodes (Sentient Civs) were all found. Explorers began finding only "Minor Nodes"—islands of pure biology (giant insects, sentient plants, elemental pockets).  
* **The Sustainment:** These Minor Nodes kept the lights on, but they didn't expand the culture. Harmony entered a period of comfortable stagnation.  
* **The Logistics:** To integrate a Node, a crew had to stay behind to maintain the "Outward Flow" battery. Being an Exploranaut meant saying goodbye forever to hold the door open for the rest of civilization.

### **Era 5: The Silent Era (80 Years Ago \- Present)**

* **The Crisis:** The Minor Nodes dried up. The Ocean of Aether became impassable. Monsters crowded the shores, locking Harmony onto its continent.  
* **The Bravery of the Vanes:** With no guarantee of return, **Captain Elara Thorne** and **Valerius Sterling Sr.** led suicide missions into the blind mist. They mapped the currents by hand, losing ships and crew to finding *nothing*.  
* **The "Minimum":** While the general populace rested on their laurels, believing their power infinite, the Council saw the reserves dwindling. The batteries weren't critical yet, but the trend line was terrifying. To combat public apathy without causing panic, the Council began offering staggering rewards for exploration. **Elara Thorne**, with deep Council ties, saw the data and realized the existential threat: explore or starve. **Valerius Sterling Sr.**, seeing only the massive bounties, recognized a golden opportunity for glory and wealth, suspecting deeper reasons but caring only for the payout.

### **The Breakthrough (24 Months Ago)**

* **The Discovery:** A Vane scout ship detected the heat signature of the **Ash-Blood Isles**.  
* **The Hardship:** Integration was nearly impossible due to the distance and the Aether Beasts in the water.  
* **The Success:** When the Ash-Bloods accepted the "Cooling Suits" (Outward Flow) and Harmony burned their Obsidian (Inward Flow), the **Resonance** kicked in.  
* **The Safe Lane:** A literal corridor of calm water opened through the Aether storm, connecting Harmony Prime to the Ash-Blood Isles.

### **Current State: The Relocation & The Shattered Circuit**

* **The Great Move:** Using this new Safe Lane, **Vumbua Academy** (the mobile city) detached from the mainland and traveled to the Ash-Blood Isles.  
* **The Hope:** Vumbua is safe for the moment. The excitement is back up\! If they can keep the momentum going, the fear of the looming horizon will be a memory.  
* **The Dean's Secret (The Shattered Circuit):** Dean Isolde Vane has confirmed a terrifying mathematical reality. While the Ash-Blood and Mizizi Nodes are "Major" in size, they are outputting only **Minor Node power**.  
  * **The Leak:** Because these nodes were once part of a unified Empire, they are metaphysically "reaching out" to their missing siblings (Trench, Cloud, etc.). Energy is bleeding into the void, trying to bridge a gap that is too wide.  
  * **The Life Support:** The Nodes should have gone fully dark millennia ago. The only reason they are still functionally alive is the **Exchange Ritual**. The tenuous stories and the physical transfer of people kept a thin "Memory Thread" alive, keeping the Nodes on life support rather than letting them fully wither ("The Dark Ages").  
  * **The Ticking Clock:** Integrating a single clan (like the Ash-bloods) doesn't fix the leak; it only patches it. Each individual clan integration buys Harmony **1-2 years** of power at most. It is a stop-gap, not a solution.  
  * **The "Great Surge" Theory:** The only way to restore full output is to integrate **ALL SIX** of the Shattered Clans (**Mizizi**\-Root, **Pyre**\-Fire, **Trench**\-Earth, **Wadi**\-Water, **Renali**\-Air, and **Fulgar**\-Storm). Only when the full circuit is closed will the Nodes stop bleeding and come nearly fully back online.  
    * *The Promise:* Completing the set will trigger a surge of power not seen for thousands of years, ushering in a **500-Year Golden Age**.  
    * *The Cost:* Even this is temporary. The "Dark Ages" fossil record proves that entropy is inevitable. Once the 500 years end, the decline will begin again. Harmony’s choice will then be absolute: Double down on infinite exploration (Momentum) or accept that magic is a finite resource that eventually ends (Fate).  
* **The Player Hook:** In the **Great Library**, players can find a report titled *"The Bleached Atoll."* It details a small island found 50 years ago that had completely stagnated. The report notes that when Harmony tried to integrate it, the island simply crumbled into dust. It was too far gone. This is the fate Dean Vane fears for the Mizizi and Ash-bloods if they don't act fast.

# Daggerheart Communities

# **Communities**

### **Highborne**

Being part of a highborne community means you’re accustomed to a life of elegance, opulence, and prestige within the upper echelons of society. Traditionally, members of a highborne community possess incredible material wealth. While this can take a variety of forms depending on the community—including gold and other minerals, land, or controlling the means of production—this status always comes with power and influence. Highborne place great value on titles and possessions, and there is little social mobility within their ranks. Members of a highborne community often control the political and economic status of the areas in which they live due to their ability to influence people and the economy with their substantial wealth. The health and safety of less affluent people who live in those locations often hinges on the ability of this highborne ruling class to prioritize the well-being of their subjects over profit.

Highborne are often amiable, candid, conniving, enterprising, ostentatious, and unflappable.

### **Community feature**

Privilege: You have advantage on rolls to consort with nobles, negotiate prices, or leverage your reputation to get what you want.

### 

### **Loreborne**

Being part of a loreborne community means you’re from a society that favors strong academic or political prowess. Loreborne communities highly value knowledge, frequently in the form of historical preservation, political advancement, scientific study, skill development, or lore and mythology compilation. Most members of these communities research in institutions built in bastions of civilization, while some eclectic few thrive in gathering information from the natural world. Some may be isolationists, operating in smaller enclaves, schools, or guilds and following their own unique ethos. Others still wield their knowledge on a larger scale, making deft political maneuvers across governmental landscapes.

Loreborne are often direct, eloquent, inquisitive, patient, rhapsodic, and witty.

### **Community feature**

Well-Read: You have advantage on rolls that involve the history, culture, or politics of a prominent person or place.

### **Orderborne**

Being part of an orderborne community means you’re from a collective that focuses on discipline or faith, and you uphold a set of principles that reflect your experience there. Orderborne are frequently some of the most powerful among the surrounding communities. By aligning the members of their society around a common value or goal, such as a god, doctrine, ethos, or even a shared business or trade, the ruling bodies of these enclaves can mobilize larger populations with less effort. While orderborne communities take a variety of forms—some even profoundly pacifistic—perhaps the most feared are those that structure themselves around military prowess. In such a case, it’s not uncommon for orderborne to provide soldiers for hire to other cities or countries.

Orderborne are often ambitious, benevolent, pensive, prudent, sardonic, and stoic.

### **Community feature**

Dedicated: Record three sayings or values your upbringing instilled in you. Once per rest, when you describe how you’re embodying one of these principles through your current action, you can roll a \*\*d20\*\* as your Hope Die.

### **Ridgeborne**

Being part of a ridgeborne community means you’ve called the rocky peaks and sharp cliffs of the mountainside home. Those who’ve lived in the mountains often consider themselves hardier than most because they’ve thrived among the most dangerous terrain many continents have to offer. These groups are adept at adaptation, developing unique technologies and equipment to move both people and products across difficult terrain. As such, ridgeborne grow up scrambling and climbing, making them sturdy and strong-willed. Ridgeborne localities appear in a variety of forms—some cities carve out entire cliff faces, others construct castles of stone, and still more live in small homes on windblown peaks. Outside forces often struggle to attack ridgeborne groups, as the small militias and large military forces of the mountains are adept at utilizing their high-ground advantage.

Ridgeborne are often bold, hardy, indomitable, loyal, reserved, and stubborn.

### **Community feature**

Steady: You have advantage on rolls to traverse dangerous cliffs and ledges, navigate harsh environments, and use your survival knowledge.

### **Seaborne**

Being part of a seaborne community means you lived on or near a large body of water. Seaborne communities are built, both physically and culturally, around the specific waters they call home. Some of these groups live along the shore, constructing ports for locals and travelers alike. These harbors function as centers of commerce, tourist attractions, or even just a safe place to lay down one’s head after weeks of travel. Other seaborne live on the water in small boats or large ships, with the idea of “home” comprising a ship and its crew, rather than any one landmass. No matter their exact location, seaborne communities are closely tied to the ocean tides and the creatures who inhabit them. Seaborne learn to fish at a young age, and train from birth to hold their breath and swim in even the most tumultuous waters. Individuals from these groups are highly sought after for their sailing skills, and many become captains of vessels, whether within their own community, working for another, or even at the helm of a powerful naval operation.

Seaborne are often candid, cooperative, exuberant, fierce, resolute, and weathered.

### **Community feature**

Know the Tide: You can sense the ebb and flow of life. When you roll with Fear, place a token on your community card. You can hold a number of tokens equal to your level. Before you make an action roll, you can spend any number of these tokens to gain a \+1 bonus to the roll for each token spent. At the end of each session, clear all unspent tokens.

### **Slyborne**

Being part of a slyborne community means you come from a group that operates outside the law, including all manner of criminals, grifters, and con artists. Members of slyborne communities are brought together by their disparate goals and their clever means of achieving them. Many people in these communities have an array of unscrupulous skills: forging, thievery, smuggling, and violence. People of any social class can be slyborne, from those who have garnered vast wealth and influence to those without a coin to their name. To the outside eye, slyborne might appear to be ruffians with no loyalty, but these communities possess some of the strictest codes of honor which, when broken, can result in a terrifying end for the transgressor.

Slyborne are often calculating, clever, formidable, perceptive, shrewd, and tenacious.

### **Community feature**

Scoundrel: You have advantage on rolls to negotiate with criminals, detect lies, or find a safe place to hide.

### **Underborne**

Being part of an underborne community means you’re from a subterranean society. Many underborne live right beneath the cities and villages of other collectives, while some live much deeper. These communities range in size from small groups in burrows to massive metropolises in caverns of stone. In many locales, underborne are recognized for their incredible boldness and skill that enable great feats of architecture and engineering. Underborne are regularly hired for their bravery, as even the least daring among them has likely encountered formidable belowground beasts, and learning to dispatch such creatures is common practice amongst these societies. Because of the dangers of their environment, many underborne communities develop unique nonverbal languages that prove equally useful on the surface.

Underborne are often composed, elusive, indomitable, innovative, resourceful, and unpretentious.

### **Community feature**

Low-Light Living: When you’re in an area with low light or heavy shadow, you have advantage on rolls to hide, investigate, or perceive details within that area.

### **Wanderborne**

Being part of a wanderborne community means you’ve lived as a nomad, forgoing a permanent home and experiencing a wide variety of cultures. Unlike many communities that are defined by their locale, wanderborne are defined by their traveling lifestyle. Because of their frequent migration, wanderborne put less value on the accumulation of material possessions in favor of acquiring information, skills, and connections. While some wanderborne are allied by a common ethos, such as a religion or a set of political or economic values, others come together after shared tragedy, such as the loss of their home or land. No matter the reason, the dangers posed by life on the road and the choice to continue down that road together mean that wanderborne are known for their unwavering loyalty.

Wanderborne are often inscrutable, magnanimous, mirthful, reliable, savvy, and unorthodox.

### **Community feature**

Nomadic Pack: Add a Nomadic Pack to your inventory. Once per session, you can spend a Hope to reach into this pack and pull out a mundane item that’s useful to your situation. Work with the GM to figure out what item you take out.

### **Wildborne**

Being part of a wildborne community means you lived deep within the forest. Wildborne communities are defined by their dedication to the conservation of their homelands, and many have strong religious or cultural ties to the fauna they live among. This results in unique architectural and technological advancements that favor sustainability over short-term, high-yield results. It is a hallmark of wildborne societies to integrate their villages and cities with the natural environment and avoid disturbing the lives of the plants and animals. While some construct their lodgings high in the branches of trees, others establish their homes on the ground beneath the forest canopy. It’s not uncommon for wildborne to remain reclusive and hidden within their woodland homes.

Wildborne are often hardy, loyal, nurturing, reclusive, sagacious, and vibrant.

### **Community feature**

Lightfoot: Your movement is naturally silent. You have advantage on rolls to move without being heard.

# Ignatious

Based on the setting notes and the session 0 transcript, here is the lore breakdown for the Ash Bloods (Volcano Clan), separated by what is commonly known/believed by the PC (Ignatius) and what secrets or deeper lore are currently hidden or serve as subtext.

### **The Ash Bloods (Volcano Clan / The Pyre-Keepers)**

**PC Representative:** Ignatius (played by John Hagey) **Ancestry:** Emberkin (Half-obsidian appearance) **Biome:** Volcanic Isles (off the main continent) **Node:** Heat/Fire

---

#### **1\. Known History & Beliefs (What Ignatius Knows)**

* **The Age of Embers:** According to clan lore, there was once a time of "great heat and flame." However, when the clan stopped communicating with others and went into isolation, the flames went "cold" and turned to embers. For generations, heating a simple pot of water required massive boulders of heat-rock.  
* **The Arrival of Harmony:** When Harmony’s ships arrived, the volcanoes physically reacted. The embers became hot again. The clan attributes this reinvigoration directly to the arrival of outsiders, validating their lore that isolation causes the cold.  
* **Current Relationship:** Of all the clans, the Ash Bloods are the most excited about Harmony. They have an active "normal trade" relationship, exchanging their hyper-specialized heat rocks and labor for Harmony’s "generalized energy" (batteries/petrol) and medicine,.  
* **The "Contract of Blood":** The clan maintains strict bloodline exchanges (marriage/partners) with outsiders to prevent corruption and inbreeding, viewing social presence as vital to their survival.

#### **2\. The Internal Conflict (The Softening)**

* **Reliance on Tech:** Harmony technology has made life significantly easier. A "pebble" of heat now does the work of a boulder.  
* **Cultural Anxiety:** While the clan is physically thriving due to better medicine and food, the Elders fear the youth are becoming "soft." The effort required to maintain the embers defined their character; now that the fires burn effortlessly with Harmony tech, that discipline is fading.

#### **3\. Ignatius’s Specific Perspective (PC Motivation)**

* **The Rebel Theory:** Unlike the rest of his clan, Ignatius believes the "reinvigoration" of the volcano is a lie. He believes Harmony’s fuel source is "fake" and that the clan is swapping out their sacred, real fuel for an artificial substitute.  
* **The Pilgrimage:** Ignatius got into trouble for exploring forbidden areas to prove this theory. He frames his banishment to the Academy not as punishment, but as a "pilgrimage" to find a *new, true* source of heat to return the clan to the "way it should be",.

---

#### **4\. Hidden Lore & Subtext (For Later Reveal)**

* **The "Curse of Ash":** The clan deeply fears that if the world stops expanding, the "Curse of Ash" will return, freezing their vents entirely. This ties directly to the Harmony "Minimum" crisis—if the civilization stops expanding/stitching the world together, the power fails.  
* **The Nature of the Node:** The clan believes the fire is a living entity that requires "social presence" to survive. This may explain why the volcano flared when Harmony arrived—not because of Harmony's *tech*, but because of the connection/stitching to the wider world.  
* **Fate of Previous Students:** The Ash Bloods have sent students to Vumbua Academy before. It is noted that "so far no one's come back, not really," though they send letters. Whether they have simply fully integrated into Harmony society or something more nefarious has happened to them remains ambiguous.  
* **Economic Reality:** While Harmony uses the Ash Bloods' labor, the Ash Bloods technically hold an "infinite resource" (magma/heat), whereas Harmony’s batteries are merely more efficient storage that is currently "running lean",. The balance of power may shift if Harmony hits "The Minimum."

# Aggie and Britt

Based on the session 0 transcript and setting notes, here is the lore breakdown for the Mizizi (Deep-Root/Mycelium Clan), distinguishing between the PCs' known reality and the hidden subtext.

### **The Mizizi (The Deep-Root Clan / The Mycelium)**

**PC Representatives:** **Aggie** (played by Kristina/Luke S audio source) and **Britt** (played by Sophie Foreman Noone). **Ancestry:** Described as "Turtle-Mushroom Folk" (Mechanically likely a Galapa/Fungril mix). They reside in fossilized mega-flora and hollowed-out roots. **Biome:** The Petrifaction Fields / Fungal Deep. **Node:** Earth/Growth (Corrupted or Wild).

---

#### **1\. The Characters: Aggie & Britt**

* **Visual Distinction:**  
  * **Aggie (Kristina):** Looks more like a red-and-white spotted mushroom (resembling a Mario mushroom) combined with a turtle. She is physically quieter, tending to "waddle" toward dark, safe corners when overwhelmed.  
  * **Britt (Sophie):** Similar fungal-turtle physiology but colored gray, dusty, and powdery. She is more outwardly aggressive and cynical.  
* **Relationship:** They are cousins who grew up together (referenced as attending "turtle camp"). They were not previously "best friends" but were forced together by age and circumstance. However, they have bonded over a shared secret suspicion of Harmony.  
* **Motivations:**  
  * **Britt:** Believes "the call is coming from inside the house." She views her attendance at the Academy as an infiltration mission to uncover the conspiracy behind Harmony.  
  * **Aggie:** Shares this skepticism but is quieter about it. She believes Harmony is responsible for the imbalance in their world and wants to find out how.

#### **2\. Known History & Beliefs (What Aggie & Britt Know)**

* **The Philosophy of Decay:** The clan holds a fervent belief that "things must die." Their lore states, "when things stop dying, we start dying." They view their survival as dependent on the natural cycle of death and decay.  
* **The Forest’s Failure:** For centuries, the fossilized forest kept them segregated from the world. Recently, the forest "failed" to keep outsiders out, which the clan interprets as the world stopping its natural death cycle.  
* **The Trade Deal:** Harmony explorers (led by a "Paper Man" in a sterile suit) established contact. The clan entered a trade agreement: Harmony takes soil, roots, bark, and stone. In exchange, Harmony provides weapons and tools to help the clan destroy/prune their own home. The PCs view themselves as a "fire brigade," trying to kill the forest growth that has become unmanageable.  
* **The Academy Invitation:** This is not the first time the Mizizi have sent students to Vumbua, but previous students haven't returned (though they send letters). Aggie and Britt were elected to join this year's massive intake.

#### **3\. Hidden Lore & Subtext (For Later Reveal)**

* **The Nature of the Node:** The SRD notes their Node is "Earth/Growth (Corrupted or Wild)". This explains why the forest is overgrowing and requires constant culling. The "failure" of the forest to keep people out is actually the Node becoming active or corrupted, possibly reacting to Harmony's proximity.  
* **The "Paper Man":** The initial contact was made by a man described as "sterile," wearing metal (which the clan does not use). This creates a thematic conflict between the *preservation/sterility* of Harmony (who fear the "Minimum" and loss of power) and the *decay/cycle* philosophy of the Mizizi.  
* **The "Recyclers":** The Mizizi are described in the setting notes as the "recyclers" of the world. Harmony’s crisis is "Stagnation" (expansion stops, reality dissolves). The Mizizi belief that "things must die" is the direct antithesis to Harmony's fear of the "Ether/Nether" dissolution. Harmony tries to stitch the world together to stop it from fading; the Mizizi believe things *must* fade to allow for life.  
* **The Unstoppable Growth:** Outside the forest, Harmony industry is trying to harvest wood, but the forest grows back faster than they can cut it. This suggests the Node is currently over-active or defensive, contradicting Harmony's belief that new Nodes are "shattered" or "weak".

# Iggy

Based on the session 0 transcript and the setting notes, here is the lore breakdown for **Holly Strebel’s character** (referred to here as the "Deepkin" or Earthkin) and **Ignatius** (John Hagey’s character), separating their known reality from the hidden subtext.

### **The "Deepkin" / Earthkin (The Subterranean/Mud Clan)**

**PC Representative:** Holly Strebel’s Character (Unnamed in transcript, described as "The Mole" archetype). **Ancestry:** Earthkin (described as semi-human shaped but made of packed dirt/mud that is constantly crumbling). **Biome:** Deep Underground / Underwater (Requires pressurized goggles and moisture to survive on the surface). **Node:** Water/Earth (Linked to the River Clan via treaty).

---

#### **1\. Character Details: "The Mole"**

* **Physiology:** He is chronically sickly and physically overwhelmed by the surface environment. He possesses giant bug eyes that require pressurized fluid injections (via goggles) and skin that steams in the sun, requiring constant application of a mud-like sunscreen.  
* **Personality:** Grumpy, comedic, and secretive. He constantly mumbles to himself and curses the environment. He is paranoid, taking zigzagging routes to cover his tracks.  
* **Arrival:** He emerged from the water at a dock. An old man (possibly a plant or just a bystander) threw a heavy trench coat over him, which provided him a moment of physical contentment due to the weight/pressure.

#### **2\. Known History & Beliefs (What He Knows)**

* **Isolation:** His clan has almost zero contact with the surface world. He is completely alien to Harmony society.  
* **The Bridal Exchange:** The only contact his people have with others is a "blood exchange" bridal ceremony with the **River Clan** (The Wadi). Once a year, someone jumps into the water, and his clan pulls them down, while one of his people goes to the shore, never to return. This acts as a genetic exchange to prevent population collapse.  
* **Motivation:** He wants to absorb as much information as possible about the surface world, though his specific mission is secretive. He is effectively "going rogue" or acting on motives potentially unapproved by his clan.

#### **3\. Hidden Lore & Subtext (For Later Reveal)**

* **The "Lost Bond":** The setting notes mention the River Clan (Wadi) lost their bond with the Air Clan, causing their river to dry up into the "Dry Vein". Holly’s character likely represents the *other* half of the River Clan's survival strategy—the deep underground water sources.  
* **The "Old Man":** The man at the dock who gave him the coat was unbothered by a mud-creature emerging from the sea. This suggests either that Harmony has better surveillance than the PC thinks, or that there are sympathizers watching for the "Deepkin."  
* **The Node Status:** The River Clan’s Node is described as "Weak/Trickling". Holly’s character may be the key to why the water retreated underground, or he may unknowingly carry the connection to a deeper, more stable Water Node.

---

### **The Ash Bloods (The Volcano Clan)**

**PC Representative:** **Ignatius** (played by John Hagey). **Ancestry:** Emberkin (Half-obsidian appearance). **Biome:** Volcanic Isles (off the main continent). **Node:** Heat/Fire.

---

#### **1\. Character Details: Ignatius ("Iggy")**

* **Personality:** A rebellious teenager. He views himself as a "new kid on the block" who is in awe of the city but fiercely critical of its artificiality.  
* **Motivation:** He believes he is on a "pilgrimage." While the Elders banished him for exploring forbidden areas and "fleeing," he reframes this as a holy mission to find a *true* source of heat to replace the "fake" Harmony fuel.

#### **2\. Known History & Beliefs (What Ignatius Knows)**

* **The Age of Embers:** Ignatius knows the clan’s fires were merely embers until Harmony arrived. Harmony’s technology "reinvigorated" the volcano, making life easier.  
* **The "Fake" Flame:** Unlike his clan, who embraced Harmony with excitement and trade, Ignatius believes Harmony’s "Crystal Batteries" (which act like little suns) are a false religion. He believes the clan is trading their cultural soul for easy heating.  
* **Trade Relations:** The Ash Bloods provide labor and hyper-specialized heat rocks. In exchange, they get Harmony’s "generalized energy" (batteries/petrol) which is currently more efficient than their rocks.

#### **3\. Hidden Lore & Subtext (For Later Reveal)**

* **The "Curse of Ash":** The Elders’ obsession with Harmony isn't just about comfort; it is fear. They believe if the world stops expanding (Stagnation), the "Curse of Ash" will return, freezing their vents entirely.  
* **Social Fire:** The clan believes the Node is a living entity that requires "social presence" to survive. The volcano didn't flare because of Harmony's *tech*, but because of the connection to the wider world. Ignatius’s isolationist views might actually threaten the Node if he isn't careful.  
* **Infinite Resource vs. The Minimum:** Harmony is facing "The Minimum" (energy crisis). Ignatius believes his clan is the weaker partner, but in reality, the Ash Bloods possess an "infinite resource" (magma), while Harmony’s batteries are running lean. Ignatius is unknowingly sitting on the solution to Harmony's impending collapse.

# Loami

Based on the session 0 transcript and the setting notes, here is the lore breakdown for **Lomi** (played by Luke Foreman) and his "clan" (The Harmony/City Working Class).

### **The Harmony (The City of Vumbua / The Infrastructure)**

**PC Representative:** **Lomi** (spelled L-O-M-I in the transcript). **Ancestry:** **Earthkin** (or Earthkin/Human mix). **Biome:** The City of Harmony (specifically the Boiler Room/Underground). **Node:** Crystal Batteries (The Central Network).

---

#### **1\. Character Details: Lomi**

* **Visuals:** Lomi is described as a "blue-collar grease monkey" who appears perpetually dirty. The distinction between his skin and the dirt is blurred, described as being in a "perpetual state of messiness".  
* **Background:** He is older than the average student (described as the "25-year-old at boot camp"). He comes from a long line of boiler workers; his family home hangs schematics of the original boilers on the wall rather than art.  
* **Personality:** He is "Union Strong" and pragmatic. He scolds people for littering or disrespecting public infrastructure, reminding them that the city wouldn't run without people like him.  
* **Motivation:** He views himself as the "big smart guy" regarding mechanics. His family encouraged him to join the Academy because "someone's got to fix the ship if it goes wrong." He is there to ensure the infrastructure of exploration survives.

#### **2\. Known History & Beliefs (What Lomi Knows)**

* **The History of Harmony:** Unlike the isolated clans, Lomi knows Harmony has a history spanning thousands of years. He knows the civilization functions like "cities that eat other cities" in terms of energy—the culture revolves entirely around finding and assimilating new lands.  
* **The Contracting World:** Lomi is aware of a phenomenon where islands and landmasses physically get closer to the Harmony Core over time. What used to be distant islands are now much closer in mileage. He knows this is a fact of their world, even if the metaphysical "why" is debated.  
* **The "New Buzz":** He joined the Academy now because he sensed a shift. After 80 years of stagnation where no new civilizations were found, there is a sudden "reinvigorated buzz" about exploration, and he wants to be part of the solution.

#### **3\. Hidden Lore & Subtext (For Later Reveal)**

* **The "Minimum" Crisis:** Lomi works in the boiler room, meaning he is physically closest to Harmony's deepest secret: the power is failing. While he may attribute flickering lights or engine stalls to mechanical maintenance issues, the reality is that Harmony is hitting "The Minimum." The civilization has stopped expanding, so the "batteries" are running out of metaphysical charge.  
* **The Nature of the "Stitching":** Lomi knows the world gets closer together, but the hidden lore is that this is the "Great Stitching." New Nodes act as gravity wells for reality. If Harmony stops exploring, the "stitching" fails, and reality will begin to dissolve into the "Ether/Nether".  
* **The Academy's Desperation:** Lomi likely believes he got in because of his skill. The hidden reality is that the Academy has radically shifted its admissions policy to a "Great Cull" strategy. They are desperate for bodies to throw at the frontier because early scans of the new territory suggest the Nodes there are "shattered" or weak. They aren't looking for "Glory Seekers" anymore; they need "Survivalists" like Lomi to keep the lights on.

# Ahs Bloods

Based on the **Vumbua Academy** lore and **Session 0** notes, here is the breakdown of the Ash-Blood (Pyre-Keeper) presence at the Academy, their internal conflicts, and how they relate to **Ignatius**.

### **Overview: The Ash-Blood Diaspora**

The Ash-Bloods are currently the "celebrities" of the intake. Because their "Integration" (The Stitching) was a recent, massive success that physically reignited their volcanoes, they are generally viewed by Harmony as the model minority—proof that the Empire works.

However, a deep ideological schism exists between those who embrace Harmony (The Integrated) and those who fear it (The Heretics/Rebels).

---

### **1\. Key Ash-Blood NPCs**

#### **A. Lady Ignis (The Matriarch)**

* **Role:** Representative of the Clans on the High Council.  
* **Rank:** Political VIP (Above Academy Ranks).  
* **Relation to Ignatius:** She is the Matriarch. Ignatius would know her well; she likely signed off on his "pilgrimage" (banishment).  
* **Motive:** **Survival via Politics.** She enacted the "Expansion Bill" to move the Academy to the Ash-Blood Isles. She believes political power is the only way to ensure her people are partners, not fuel.  
* **Campaign Fit:** She represents the "Establishment." If Ignatius rebels against Harmony, he is directly embarrassing her and endangering the treaty she forged \[`842`\].

#### **B. Pyrrhus (The Heretic)**

* **Role:** Unregistered Scholar / Laborer. Found in the **Great Library**.  
* **Rank:** None (Likely hiding among the workforce or Copper tier).  
* **Relation to Ignatius:** A warning. Pyrrhus was an ex-priest banished for claiming the Ancestors were "screaming." Ignatius likely heard rumors of him as a cautionary tale of what happens when you resist.  
* **Motive:** **Expose the Parasite.** He believes the heat isn't fading naturally; it is being *diverted* to feed the Spire.  
* **Campaign Fit:** He is the primary hook for the "Energy Crisis" plot. He drops the map fragment showing the "Heat Sink" under the Dean’s office \[`1004`, `1033`\].

#### **C. Squad 06: "The Kiln" (The Rivals)**

* **Role:** The "Model Students." They are the foil to Ignatius. They wear full containment suits and refuse to use "wild fire."  
* **Class/Rank:** **Silver / Seraphs** \[`939`\].  
* **Members:**  
  1. **Cinder-4 (Leader):** Abandoned his clan name for a number to fit the Loom’s catalog. He believes civilization is the only shield against the cold.  
  2. **Hearth:** Seeks the comfort of a "Steady Flame" over volcanic bursts.  
  3. **Kindle:** Mesmerized by the "Clean Light" of Harmony tech; views clan fire as dirty.  
* **Interaction:** Cinder-4 confronts Ignatius in the locker rooms: *"Stop showing off that wild flame, brother. Put on the containment suit."* \[`945`\].

#### **D. Lady Glissade (The Captain)**

* **Role:** Explorer Captain (The "North Ice" bet).  
* **Status:** Integrated Ash-Blood.  
* **Motive:** **Temperature Regulation.** She uses her natural Ash-Blood heat to survive harvesting glacial ice without freezing, proving Ash-Bloods have utility beyond just boilers.  
* **Campaign Fit:** A potential mentor who uses her heritage for industry rather than combat \[`947`\].

---

### **2\. How Many Are There?**

While the exact number isn't listed, we can extrapolate from the demographics:

* **Total Intake:** 100,000 candidates.  
* **Ash-Blood Presence:** They are a minority, but a visible one.  
* **Squad 06 ("The Kiln"):** 3 Members.  
* **Ignatius:** 1 Member.  
* **Pyrrhus:** 1 Member.  
* **Background Students:** There is a "small circle" of Ash-Bloods mentioned at the bonfire trying to light a True Spark, distinct from the majority using Safe-Flame \[`1000`\].  
* **Estimated Count:** Likely **50–100** total candidates. They are rare enough to be "minor celebrities" but numerous enough to form a clique \[`969`, `1000`\].

### **3\. Who "Did Not Make The Cut"?**

Based on the Academy's attrition rates \[`931`, `987`\]:

* **The Rust Tier (20% Failure Rate):** About **20%** of the Ash-Blood candidates likely failed the "Spire Scan."  
* **Fate of the Failed:** They were not sent home. They were reassigned to **City Maintenance** (The Boiler Rooms).  
* **Why this matters to Ignatius:** The Boiler Room runs on **Direct Obsidian Transfer** \[`841`\]. The "failed" Ash-Bloods are actually the most critical workers in the city, physically feeding the engines with their heat. Ignatius will likely find many of his "failed" kin working alongside **Lomi** in the under-city, keeping the school alive while the "Gold" students get the glory.

### **4\. Ignatius’s Knowledge & Perspective**

* **How he knows them:** The clan is small enough that he would recognize Cinder-4 and Pyrrhus by sight or reputation. He knows Lady Ignis personally as the Matriarch.  
* **The Friction:** Ignatius is unique because he is a **Gold Rank** (Visionary) who holds **Heretical Views**.  
  * **Squad 06** sees him as dangerous—a "Wild Element" that could ruin their integration status.  
  * **Pyrrhus** sees him as a potential savior—someone with the rank/access to prove the Spire is stealing their heat.  
  * **Lady Ignis** sees him as a liability—a rebellious child who needs to grow up before he destroys the treaty.

# Captains

***Phase:** The 1-Month "Proving Voyage" (Internship).*

***Objective:** Field testing in the "Safe Zone" and Periphery before the deep expedition.*

***The "Captain's Boon":** Each Captain has a discretionary pool of **50 Loom Points** to award to a single candidate (or split amongst a squad) who demonstrates exceptional promise. This Boon acts as a "Direct Commission."*

## ***📋 The Selection Board***

*Candidates must secure a berth by 0800 hours. Minimum squad deployment size: 7 Candidates.*

| *Captain Name (Faction)* | *Tagline (Vibe)* | *Their Bet (Direction/Goal)* | *Ideal Candidate (Job Posting)* | *Craft (Description)* | *DM Notes (1-Month Outcome)* |

Combat skills required for 'Pest Control'."* | *A sleek, gold-plated diplomatic cruiser designed for speed and press conferences.* | ***The Guardian.** The monument is real.

| ***2\. Cpt. Kaelo "Ghost" Vane** (Vane Lineage)* | *"We were never here."* | ***Up-River Fog.** Betting on mapping hydrological anomalies in the dense fog belt to the East.* | *"Looking for 'Silence' proficiency.

Must understand 'Leverage' and 'Contracts'."* | *A luxury land-yacht walker with armed guards and velvet seats.* | ***Aether-Grazers.** They find a herd of peaceful giant beasts.

No snitches."* | *A magnetic scrap-trawler rig.* | ***Unstable Tech.** They find a weapon that might explode. High value, high danger.* |

Must be comfortable with heights."* | *A high-altitude balloon platform.* | ***The Distant Storm.** They spot a massive, unnatural storm far away (Cloud-Kin hint).* |

| ***33\. Cpt. "Iron-Hide"** (Iron-Union)* | *"The ship breaks before the crew does."* | ***The Patrol.** Betting on aether beasts threatening the coastline, determined to fight them off.* | *"Guardians. Must know the 'Piston-Lock' safety maneuver by heart."* | ***The Bulwark** The "Unsinkable" Fortress. 110% Over-Plated over-under sea behemoth* | ***The Wave.** Tower defense scenario. Endless waves of low-level beasts. Loami gets to meet his hero (who is actually just a very tired, very sturdy mechanic).* |

## ***🕵️ Key Captain Dossiers & Secret Agendas***

### ***1\. Valerius Sterling (The Glory Hound)***

* ***The Pitch:** "Join the elite. We have the best food, the best press, and the least chance of death."*  
* ***The Secret:** He isn't actually exploring. He's re-visiting a "Safe Node" discovered 20 years ago and pretending it's new for the cameras.*  
* ***The Risk:** Zero danger, but zero respect from real explorers.*

### ***2\. Kaelo "Ghost" Vane (The Spy)***

* ***The Pitch:** "The Academy needs eyes, not heroes. Help me see what the River Clan is hiding."*  
* ***The Secret:** Kaelo suspects the River Clan has a weapon that can ground the Sky-Spire.*  
* ***The Risk:** If caught, the Academy will disavow you. You will be left behind.*

### ***3\. Ignis "Scorch" (The Daredevil)***

* ***The Pitch:** "We are going to run the engine at 120% until it melts or we win."*  
* ***The Secret:** His engine is melting. He needs an Elemental (Ignatius) or a Mechanic (Loami) to physically hold it together during the climb.*  
* ***The Risk:** High probability of explosion. High probability of glory.*

### ***4\. Elara Thorne (The Saint)***

* ***The Pitch:** "We are bringing food and medicine to the 'Rust' populations stranded outside the gates."*  
* ***The Secret:** She is smuggling unregistered "Rust" candidates back into the city disguised as patients.*  
* ***The Risk:** You become an accomplice to treason against the Loom's sorting protocols.*

### ***5\. Professor Althea Ink (The Xenobotanist)***

* ***The Pitch:** "The Mizizi fear the 'Old Growth' because they say it whispers. I say it reads. Help me prove the forest is a library before the Verdant Trust mulches it."*  
* ***The Secret:** She is secretly working with **Rill** (the River-Born adoptee). Rill provides the coordinates; Ink provides the ship. They are trying to extract a "Core Sample" from an Ancient Tree to prove it contains data, not just wood.*  
* ***The Risk:** The "Whispers" in the Old Growth are psychic data-dumps. Low-Willpower characters might get overwritten by ancient history.*

### ***6\. "Old Man" Silas (The Scrapper)***

* ***The Pitch:** "I ain't got a speech. Get on the boat or don't."*  
* ***The Secret:** Silas has found a "Pre-Stitch" vault in the trash vortex. He needs a crew stupid enough to help him haul it out.*  
* ***The Risk:** Tetanus. Also, the vault might be booby-trapped.*

### ***7\. Captain "Iron-Lung" Jorah (The Submariner)***

* ***The Pitch:** "The surface is a lie. The heat is down deep. Join me in the dark."*  
* ***The Secret:** He is searching for the "Deep-Mother," a mythical creature the Trench-Kin worship.*  
* ***The Risk:** Structural implosion. Total darkness.*

### ***8\. Captain "Iron-Hide" (The Shield)***

* ***The Pitch:** "We don't run. We tank. I bring everyone home, even if I have to carry the ship myself."*  
* ***The Secret:** He isn't looking for a Node; he's field-testing a new "Ablative Hull" made of compressed Ash-blood obsidian.*  
* ***The Loami Hook:** Iron-Hide is a living legend among the Iron-Union. He started as a Copper-rank boiler scrubber (just like Loami). He famously saved the last expedition by manually holding a cracked thermal vent shut with his own geomantic skin for 6 hours. He also wrote "The Percussive Maintenance Guide (Vol. 4)," which is likely the only textbook Loami actually likes.*  
* ***The Risk:** You will take damage. A lot of it. But you won't die.*  
* ***Iggy Hook:** THIS is the boat that first disrupted the tides above the deepkin shelf. It returned regularly and it is how he hitch-hiked to shore (which was massively impressive to do considering the weaponry and defenses)*

## ***🎲 The 50-Point Boon (Mechanic)***

*When the players choose a Captain, they must "Interview" (Roleplay \+ Roll).*

* ***Great Success (DC 18+):** The Captain grants the **Full Boon (+50 Points)** to the character.*  
  * *Effect: This guarantees Gold Rank for anyone (even Loami).*  
* ***Success (DC 12-17):** The Captain grants a **Partial Boon (+20 Points)**.*  
  * *Effect: Enough to bump a Silver to Gold or a Copper to Silver.*  
* ***Failure (DC \< 12):** The Captain accepts them as "Grunt Labor" (0 Points).*  
  * *Effect: They are just along for the ride. No rank increase.*

***Squad Dilemma:***

*Since **Squad 7-Alpha** must deploy together, they must convince a Captain to take all of them.*

* ***Valerius** won't take Loami (Copper).*  
* ***Ghost** thinks Britt is too loud.*  
* ***Ink** loves Iggy but fears Ignatius will burn his specimens.*  
* ***Silas** will take anyone, but offers no prestige.*

*This forces the players to leverage their connections to get the whole squad hired by a "Good" captain, or settle for the "Bad" one.*

# Living NPC latest

Based on the transcripts from **Session 0 (vumbua 1\)** and the provided lore, here is the complete list of NPCs your players have directly interacted with or observed closely, along with what was said and learned.

### **I. Key Narrative NPCs (Plot Critical)**

#### **1\. Dean Isolde Vane**

* **Role:** Head of the Academy.  
* **Interaction:** Gave the welcome speech in the Great Hall.  
* **What She Said:**  
  * "For 80 years our maps have been static."  
  * "We’ve missed the thrill of adventure. I’ve been lonely."  
  * "We don't know what the Mizizi do, and that's amazing."  
  * **The Threat:** "We have to lose another 20,000 of you by the end of the week."  
* **What Players Learned:** She acts bubbly and energetic (like a female Professor Heimerdinger), but Britt explicitly whispered, *"I don't trust this f\*\*\*ing guy."* She framed the intake as a desperate need for new discovery after a long drought \[`1170`, `1171`\].

#### **2\. Rill (The River-Born)**

* **Role:** Dean’s Attendant / Mizizi Clan Member.  
* **Interaction:** Appeared from behind the curtain to pull the Dean back. She waved to Britt and Aggie.  
* **What Players Learned:**  
  * **Transformation:** She looks much healthier and well-dressed (blue romper, turban) than when she left the forest 2 years ago as an outcast.  
  * **Status:** She has a very familiar, close relationship with the Dean (locking arms).  
  * **Recognition:** She knows Britt and Aggie personally and waved "good luck" to them \[`1173`, `1174`\].

#### **3\. Sarge (Squad 09 Leader)**

* **Role:** Warrior / Former Maintenance Worker.  
* **Interaction:** Met **Lomi** outside the exams. They know each other from workers' campfires.  
* **What He Said:**  
  * "Loaves? Loaves, we made it."  
  * Admitted he barely passed: "I don't even know what I was talking about. You always guess C, right?"  
  * "I gotta remember why I'm here. Doing this for the lads."  
* **What Players Learned:** He is insecure about his academic ability but driven by duty. He represents the "Common Man" trying to break into the elite ranks \[`1163`, `1164`\].

#### **4\. Lucky**

* **Role:** Street Urchin / Hustler.  
* **Interaction:** Approached **Iggy** and the group outside the Great Hall. Tried to sell Iggy a "Kleenex" (a stolen guard's turban).  
* **What He Said:**  
  * "I'm Lucky. You need something? You let Lucky know."  
  * "If you find something cool, I'm your guy."  
* **What Players Learned:** He is a scavenger and black-market dealer. He accepted Iggy's useless invention (the noise-making trumpet) in trade. He is fast and slippery \[`1180`, `1182`\].

#### **5\. Serra (Seraphina) Fox**

* **Role:** Student / "Ally."  
* **Interaction:** Approached the group at the crane. Invited them to the bonfire.  
* **What She Said:**  
  * "Oh my god. Are you... from the Island? And are you Ash Blood? Three of you all in one group? Oh, what a splendorous occasion\!"  
  * "I'm an ally. Is that okay to say?"  
* **What Players Learned:** She is fascinated by the Clans (almost fetishizing them). She is nervous but eager. **Ignatius** explicitly stated: *"I don't trust this b\*\*\*\*."* \[`1202`, `1206`\].

---

### **II. Atmospheric NPCs (Flavor & World Building)**

#### **6\. The "Chad" Student**

* **Role:** Aristocrat / Gold Tier vibe.  
* **Interaction:** Spoke to **Ignatius** in the courtyard.  
* **What He Said:**  
  * "Welcome to the show, mate."  
  * "Oh... will your hand burn me?" (After Ignatius offered a handshake).  
* **What Players Learned:** The Harmony students view the Ash-Bloods as exotic novelties. They assume the soot/fire is a choice or a costume that can be "wiped off" \[`1159`, `1160`\].

#### **7\. The Intake Attendant (Teal Butler)**

* **Interaction:** Tried to rush **Britt** out of the cubicle.  
* **What Players Learned:** The Academy is focused on "Throughput" and efficiency. They treat candidates like cattle to be processed \[`1146`\].

#### **8\. The Intake Supervisor**

* **Interaction:** Cleaned up **Iggy’s** slime mess on the receipt machine.  
* **What He Said:** "Welcome to Curiosity."  
* **What Players Learned:** Even the supervisors are overwhelmed by the chaos of the intake. He waved Iggy through despite Iggy not using the receipt correctly \[`1153`\].

#### **9\. The Weeping Giant & The Consoling Guard**

* **Interaction:** **Lomi** witnessed this while walking through the line.  
* **What Was Said:** "Come on, sir. Your test is done. Please don't try it again. No, you can't."  
* **What Players Learned:** The stakes are life-ruining. Failing the exam means being physically dragged away. The guards are sympathetic but firm \[`1149`\].

#### **10\. The Turban Guard**

* **Interaction:** Confronted **Iggy** about the stolen turban/tissue.  
* **What Happened:** Iggy handed back the snot-filled turban. The guard was flabbergasted.  
* **What Players Learned:** Iggy can get away with social chaos because people don't know how to react to him \[`1184`\].

#### **11\. Cassius**

* **Interaction:** **Lomi** approached him at the pit.  
* **What He Said:** "We have it all masked out... optimal flow... but, well, we don't have a source of flame yet."  
* **What Players Learned:** The students are scientifically prepared (airflow mechanics) but lack the "Spark" (Variant Magic) to actually start the fire. This sets up **Ignatius** (or Lomi) to solve the problem \[`1209`\].

### **III. Mentioned / Background (Not yet met)**

* **Lady Ignis:** Ignatius knows she is the Matriarch who signed the treaty and is now a VIP in the city \[`1117`\].  
* **Captain Elara Thorne:** Mentioned in lore as the one who escorted Lady Ignis \[`1122`\].  
* **The "Paper Man":** Mentioned in Britt/Aggie's backstory as the sterile man who brought the contract \[`1119`\].

# 0️⃣ Session 0

Here is the revised screenplay for **Session 0**, starting with the **Mizizi Clan**.

This version preserves the specific lore details regarding the clan's history, philosophy ("When things stop dying, we start dying"), and the specific nature of their pact with Harmony, as these are critical to the narrative.

---

### **SCENE 1: THE TURTLE-MUSHROOM FATE**

**INT. VIRTUAL TABLETOP \- NIGHT**

**GM (LUKE S)** (Laughing) Yeah, you were a turtle combined with the mushroom. Turtle mushroom thing.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** Literally mine too. I'm telling you there's like—we think the same or something.

**JOHN HAGEY (IGNATIUS)** This was fate. This was decided by fate. We're not changing anything.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** You can't fight fate.

**GM (LUKE S)** And you just defined your clan so well... the turtle mushroom folk who live in the swamp.

**(NARRATION)**

**GM (LUKE S)** Your home is inside this huge fossilized mega-flora... somewhere between the Pandora tree and hobbit holes. Your family history is all about one thing: "When things must die." The legends, the lore that you have been taught as a harrowing tale is: **"When things stop dying, we start dying."**

(Beat)

**GM (LUKE S)** It's weird... like a relationship with life and death that's not normal. It's scary when things stop dying. And that's why your clan has been really concerned lately because things *have* started to not die. The forest, which kept you segregated for hundreds of years, failed. The lore often talks about how the purpose of the forest is to keep you apart from the world because when the world comes, things stop dying.

**(FLASHBACK: THE ARRIVAL OF THE PAPER MAN)**

**GM (LUKE S)** Last cycle, or maybe two cycles ago... a group came, led by a man in what seemed to you to be a very sterile outfit. It didn't have any moss growing off of it. It had no holes in it. It was just very bland and had metal on it. Y'all don't wear metal.

**GM (LUKE S)** The man started bringing things that the elders were now distributing to the clan... you became like the fire brigade. You were starting to just try to destroy the forest around you to get it to die. Harmony comes and they seem to take the soil and the roots and the bark and the stone... neither really are you sure what they're looking for. But in return, they're giving you weapons to destroy your home, which is exactly what you want.

**(RETURN TO TABLE)**

**GM (LUKE S)** Now the next generation has come... the Paper Man has offered much more of the Mycelium clan can now join the Vumbua Academy this year, and the two of you elected to join.

---

### **SCENE 2: THE COUSINS**

**INT. VIRTUAL TABLETOP \- CONTINUOUS**

**GM (LUKE S)** (To Sophie) Sophie, your character is maybe a little bit outspoken... uncertain about their relationship with Harmony, maybe even a little suspicious of it. And Kristina (Aggie), maybe you have had some gossip together about Harmony... but she may not be quite as aggressive as you.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** How would we know each other? I feel like our clan's probably not that big, right?

**GM (LUKE S)** Correct. Everyone probably knows everybody.

**AGGIE (VIA LUKE S)** (Relayed thought) I feel like it would be distant relatives... maybe cousins or second cousins. Know enough about each other that when we find out we're going to the same school, it makes sense they would connect.

**LUKE FOREMAN (LOMI)** Same year at Turtle Camp.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** (Excited) What if we're cousins and we're in the same year at school? We've always been sort of forced together... but we obviously are similar in a lot of ways.

**GM (LUKE S)** Like we go to school but we're very different groups... outspoken versus the quiet.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** I'm gonna add to our story here. I'm going to say I've had the same thoughts. We're both sort of in cahoots on like—**something is wrong**. The call is coming from inside the house. And we're about to go save our families and save all of our people... we have a mission and we're going to do it together.

---

### **SCENE 3: CIVILIZATION**

**EXT. EDGE OF THE FOREST \- DAY**

**BRITT** (Gray, dusty, powdery fungal-turtle) and **AGGIE** (Red-and-white spotted mushroom-turtle) step out of the petrified woods.

**GM (LUKE S)** You pop out in the edge of the forest... you can see what you can only really define as "civilization" coming. It is a sprawling tower surrounded by huge buildings and all of these moving metal creatures... It is an assault on your senses.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** (Narrating Action) I think my gut reaction would be to grab Kristina. Like my body stiffens and I feel overwhelmed and stunned and I communicate that with you just by reaching out.

**AGGIE (VIA LUKE S)** (Narrating Action) I think my character would be looking for a darker corner or wall... looking for that safe spot. So she kind of grabs back and waddles off to find that safe spot.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** (To Aggie) Are you more turtle or more fungus?

**AGGIE (VIA LUKE S)** Shape-wise turtle... but definitely on the mushroom side. I want the turtle shell to be like the red and white spotted mushroom that you drop into.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** I'm going to be a similar vibe... but much more gray and sort of dusty, powdery.

**GM (LUKE S)** As you exit this forest, you're close enough to the Ash Bloods' homes that you can see on the horizon the smoke of their perpetual volcano. And the only people out here are the folks who have made arrangements with the Mycelium clan to come and harvest some of the wood... logging is helping kill the forest and then it's just growing right back.

,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here is the continuation of the screenplay for **Session 0**, covering the introductions of the Earthkin, Emberkin, and Lomi, followed by The Trials.

---

### **SCENE 4: THE DOCKS**

**EXT. VUMBUA DOCKS \- DAY**

**THE MOLE (HOLLY)**, a chronically sickly Earthkin made of packed, crumbling dirt, emerges from the water. He wears large goggles over giant bug eyes.

**THE MOLE (HOLLY)** (Mumbling, frantic) I gotta get more sunscreen.

He scrambles to cover himself, injecting pressurized fluid into his goggles to stop them from steaming in the sun. He moves erratically, taking a zigzagging route to absorb information while covering his tracks.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Describing the Scene) I kind of like this idea that when he came up... there was an old man sitting on the side of the wharf... just waddles over and throws a really heavy trench coat on top of you. And it's very heavy and it compresses on your shoulders a little bit.

**THE MOLE (HOLLY)** (Exhales deeply) (Blinks, shooting water out of goggles) ...Contentment as he has weight back on him.

---

### **SCENE 5: THE PILGRIMAGE**

**EXT. THE EMBER TRAIL \- DAY**

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)**, a rebellious Emberkin teenager with a backpack, arrives in the city. He looks at the magitek lights powered by Harmony's crystal batteries.

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** (Internal Monologue) We're subbing out our own fuel for this fake stuff. It's all fake. It's all wrong. It's not how it should be.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Clarifying) To the elders, you were banished to this trial of adventure...

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** (To the Elders, in Flashback) No, this is simply a pilgrimage.

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** (Internal Monologue) I'm going to find the new source of heat for the clan and everything's going to go back to the way it should be.

---

### **SCENE 6: THE BOILER ROOM**

**INT. VUMBUA UNDER-CITY \- BOILER ROOM \- DAY**

**LOMI (LUKE F)** finishes a shift at the furnace. He is a "blue-collar grease monkey," perpetually covered in soot and dirt. He grabs his gear, not bothering to shower, and heads up to the Academy.

**EXT. VUMBUA STREETS \- CONTINUOUS**

Lomi walks toward the Academy. He spots a **RECEPTIONIST** casually shredding a document and tossing it into a bin without looking. Lomi stops.

**LOMI (LUKE F)** Hey, you know, there's people in this city that take care of that stuff. You know, it doesn't just get done.

The Receptionist stares at him.

**LOMI (LUKE F)** Public infrastructure is important and there are people that run this city.

Lomi walks away, muttering. He recalls his family's advice: *"Someone's got to fix the ship if it goes wrong."*

---

### **SCENE 7: THE TRIALS**

**INT. VUMBUA ACADEMY \- GREAT HALL \- DAY**

The group joins 100,000 other candidates.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) The application is... you show up to take the trials and that's your application... that's why there's 100,000 people showing up.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Describing the Vibe) "Come be an explorer. The time is now. The world is open." Very 1920s somewhere in between like *Avatar Korra* type world that's just really excited for this opportunity.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Explaining the Mechanics) The trials is what ranks your likelihood of being a successful candidate... it gives you a role, an explorer role... which it basically is going to be your Daggerheart Class.

The players take the assessment (a meta-game survey).

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** This feels like *Ender's Game* style stuff and I love it.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Reviewing Results) I was determined to make it so that it would be really hard to meta the result. It is... super interesting.

**LOMI (LUKE F)** Is it an "Oops, all bards" situation or are we pretty good?

**GM (LUKE S)** No, no, it's actually like... the party is pretty well balanced. Like zero repeat classes.

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** Wow. Even me and Kristina (Aggie) didn't have the same one?

**GM (LUKE S)** No, you guys do not. Not really even close on this one.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Closing the Session) The crew will have a chance at the "Chosen One" storyline. I'll tell you that like... none of you are "Rust," which is the bottom tier.

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** Yo, good work team.

**FADE OUT.**

# Radio Recap(s)

Good evening, citizens of Harmony and dreamers of the Frontier\! This is Sterling Vance, broadcasting live from the gleaming spires of Vumbua Academy. Today marks the Great Intake, where one hundred thousand hopefuls have flooded our gates, seeking not just glory, but survival. The air is electric, the magitek is humming, and we have our eyes on a very specific, very peculiar set of candidates making waves on the intake floor.

Let's start with a twist of destiny that has the registrars buzzing. I’m looking at two candidates from the Mycelium Clan—Britt and Aggie. And would you believe it? Despite coming from the deep Petrifaction Fields, they have arrived with an almost identical aesthetic. I am hearing one of the Ash Blood candidates, Ignatius, shouting it from the crowd right now—he is calling it fate\! He is yelling, "This was decided by fate. We're not changing anything." And folks, he is right. They are both Turtle-Mushroom folk\!

Let’s dig into the background of these two. We are pulling the archives on the Mizizi Clan lore, and it is chilling. Their history is defined by one terrifying truth: "When things stop dying, we start dying." Can you imagine? Living in fossilized mega-flora, terrified that the world has stopped decaying? And it has\! The forest failed to keep them segregated.

We know a "Paper Man" arrived in their village wearing a sterile outfit. He brought weapons. Harmony takes their soil and roots, and in exchange, the clan gets tools to destroy their own home just to help it die. Grim stuff\!

Now, let's look at these cousins. Britt appears "outspoken and kind of aggressive," clearly suspicious of Harmony. Her cousin, Aggie? Skeptical, but quieter. They aren't best friends, but they are forced together. And oh, listen to this whisper from Britt to her cousin—she says, "The call is coming from inside the house." They are in cahoots\! They are on a mission to save their families from the conspiracy they believe is rotting Harmony from within\!

Watch them as they approach the city gates. The academy is an assault on the senses. Britt’s body stiffens. She is overwhelmed. She reaches out and grabs Aggie. And Aggie? She is looking for a "darker corner." She grabs back and waddles off to find a safe spot. Two turtle-mushroom cousins against the world\!

Now, pan your attention to the docks. Something is emerging from the water. It’s an Earthkin, made of packed, crumbling dirt with giant bug eyes\! He looks "chronically sickly." He is steaming in the sun\! He is frantically injecting fluid into his goggles and zig-zagging to avoid being tracked. He is mumbling to himself, "I gotta get more sunscreen."

But wait—there is an old man on the wharf. He isn't shocked. He just walks over and throws a heavy trench coat over the mud-man. The Earthkin exhales, water shoots out of his goggles, and he seems to find "contentment as he has weight back on him." A trench coat to save the day\!

Turning our eyes to the Ember Trail\! Here comes the Emberkin teenager, Ignatius. He is half-obsidian, and he is in a rebellious phase. We are hearing reports that he believes Harmony is providing a "false religion flame." He says, "We’re subbing out our own fuel for this fake stuff." He was banished for exploring forbidden areas, but he is reframing the narrative\! I am hearing him say it now: "No, this is simply a pilgrimage." He is here to find a real flame. That is a kid with a chip on his shoulder\!

And finally, let’s go underground. Down to the boiler room. We have Lomi. He is a blue-collar grease monkey, folks. You can’t tell where the skin ends and the dirt begins. He is finishing a shift and heading straight to the Academy.

Oh, this is good. He’s walking past a receptionist shredding a document, and Lomi stops. He is scolding them\! He says, "Hey, you know, there's people in this city that take care of that stuff. Public infrastructure is important and there are people that run this city." You tell 'em, Lomi\! The city runs on boilers, not magic\!

Now, the moment of truth. The Trials\! One hundred thousand candidates are taking the psychological assessment. Ignatius says it feels like "Ender's Game style stuff." The results are coming in... the administration is reviewing them. Is it an "Oops, All Bards" situation?

No\! The results are in. The party is pretty well balanced. Like zero repeat classes. I am shocked—even the mushroom cousins have different classes\! Ignatius chimes in with a "Yo, good work team."

And there you have it, listeners\! They have survived the cull. They are not "Rust" tier. They are a perfectly balanced crew of misfits ready to save—or break—the world. Lets see how these new candidates fair in their gen-ed classes next time\! This is Sterling Vance, signing off\!

# Good evening, citizens of Harmony and dreamers of the Frontier\!

This is Sterling Vance, broadcasting live from the gleaming galleries of the Sky-Spire.

It has been eighty long, quiet years since a new Node was last integrated—a lifetime of static maps and dwindling dreams. But now? Fervor is sweeping through Harmony like a solar gale\! Vumbua has weighed anchor and settled into it’s new home\! From the high cafes of the Sky-Spire to the bustling decks of the Deep-Hull, every citizen is asking: What lies in this new Terra?

We’ve all heard the legends of the Ash-blood domains, where the earth itself pulses with a primal heat that promises to reignite our aging forges\! And what of the Mizizi? Their Node is a miracle that defies every law of the Loom—a resonance that holds death at bay\! Imagine the medicines, the longevity, the pure vitality we are about to stitch into our Core. What other riches will Captains Aris and Valerius bring back to our hearths? The results of these trials are being crunched by the Loom even as I speak, determining who will be the tip of the spear in this new age of discovery\!"

"Today marks the Great Intake\! One hundred thousand hopefuls have flooded our Anchorage, and the air is electric with the arrival of our newest clan members. Let's start with a twist of destiny that has the registrars buzzing. I’m looking at two candidates from the Mizizi Clan And would you believe it? Despite coming from the deep Petrifaction Fields, they have arrived with an almost identical turtle-mushroom aesthetic. I am hearing the Ash-blood candidate, Ignatius, shouting it from the crowd right now—he is calling it 'Geometric Fate\!' He says they aren't changing a thing, and folks, the Loom seems to agree\!

And speaking of that boisterous Ash-blood \- He’s half-obsidian and carries a fire that matches his ambition. We’re hearing he’s on a personal 'Pilgrimage,' seeking to compare the legendary flames of his ancestors with the magnificent beacons of our own Academy. He’s looking for the ultimate spark, a quest for truth that defines the very spirit of the Venture\!"

"Now, listeners, I know we spent all of last week’s broadcast covering our aristocrats and the high-born legacies of the Sterling and Thorne lineages—but they aren't the only Harmonians showing up today\! Beyond the gilded names, thousands upon thousands of 'us normal folk' have heard the call of the frontier and flocked to our docks to try their hand at the intake exam.

We’ve got simple peasants off the low-bunks of a transport ship. Just like this one here, wow\! He’s 50% crumbling sediment and 50% waterlogged, gleaming goggles. Now look at this—academy camaraderie in action\! An old man on the wharf—I bet he’s from the class of ‘34—saw the little guy steaming in the sun and tossed a heavy, oil-stained trench coat over him\! Hah\! That seems to have done it based on the amount of water that shot out of his goggles. A trench coat to save the day\! Welcome to the sun, kid. You're part of the team now.

And we can't forget those who keep the city running while the rest of us dream. Just here, we’ve got a blue-collar hero, folks—the kind of grease monkey who keeps the heart of Vumbua beating. He’s heading straight from a double shift to the Spire Gates, and he’s already showing his leadership\! He was spotted scolding a receptionist for improper document disposal, reminding them that *'Public infrastructure is the bedrock of our success.'* Spoken like a man who understands that every bolt and rivet is a testament to Harmony. That's dedication\!"

"But as the steam settles on the intake floor, we must remember that the path of the Pioneer is narrow. While our featured candidates have successfully navigated their preliminary screenings, over twenty-two thousand others have already taken their leave—finding their purpose not on the frontier, but in the essential roles of City Maintenance and industrial support. They are the bolts that hold our floorboards together, to be sure\! But for the seventy-seven thousand hopefuls still standing, the real test has only just begun. All our eyes are fixed on rare few who will gain that most lustrous title: Exploranaut.

To earn the rank of Exploranaut is to transcend the ordinary. It is an invitation to the Great Council, a life of unparalleled prestige, and a legacy that will be whispered in the Sky-Spires for centuries. Our featured squad has passed the entry requirements\! They are the pioneers of a new age, a nearly balanced crew ready to map the unknown. Let's see how they and the other candidates fair in Ex-Ed 101 tomorrow morning\!

This is Sterling Vance, signing off. Keep your anchors heavy and your hearts light\!"

# 1️⃣ Session 1

# **Session 1: The Venture & The Vances**

**Theme:** Atlantis meets Treasure Planet. High Polish vs. Grimy Reality. **Core Conflict:** The "Savants" (PCs) vs. The "System" (The Aristocrats).

## **🏗️ Scene 0: The Intake (The Hangar Pavilion)**

**Atmosphere:** A sea of 100,000 bodies swarming the "Anchorage." The intake takes place within a cavernous, temporary iron-and-canvas vault known as **The Intake Pavilion**. This structure is massive, designed with high, vaulted ceilings that will eventually serve as the main hangars for the Academy's walkers and airships once the "Venture" begins. For now, it is a maze of velvet ropes, brass railings, and thousands of percussive typewriter stations.

**Visuals:** The air is thick with the smell of lamp oil, ozone, and the nervous sweat of 100,000 hopefuls. Above, worker-constructs crawl along the iron rafters, readying the fuel lines and docking clamps that will replace the intake desks in mere days. The noise is a constant, vibrating thrum—the rhythmic "clank-clank-clank" of the city being assembled outside, echoing within the hollow iron shell of the Pavilion.

### **The Filtering Mechanic: "The Spire Scan"**

To progress toward the Academy gates, every student must first step into one of the hundreds of **Resonance Booths** lining the Pavilion walls.

* **The Process:** You aren't asked your name. You step into the booth, and a brass ring descends over you, humming with teal energy.  
* **The Psychology:** As the ring passes your heart, the Loom triggers a "Micro-Dissolve." For one second, your body feels like it’s made of static.  
* **The "Rust" Result:** If a student's heart rate spikes too high, or their "Aura" flickers into grey-static, the booth emits a low, mournful foghorn blast.  
  * *The Guard:* "Candidate 88,210. Standing: RUST. Access Denied. Return to the transport for City Maintenance reassignment."  
  * *The Statistics:* \~22,419 candidates (20% of the intake) fail here. Their adventure ends at the very first gate.

### **The Player Intake (The Receipt)**

As the PCs pass their scans, they are directed to heavy iron desks bolted to the floor. On each sits an antiquated, 1920s-style typewriter with brass keys.

* **The Input:** They type their profiles into the lead-heavy keys. As they finish, a small, high-speed machine next to the typewriter chugs out a narrow, stiff strip of parchment—their **Loom Receipt**. This is their only proof of existence within the Academy.  
* **Britt & Iggy:** The receipt is printed on gold-flecked paper. The printer hums a melodic sequence. (100 pts)  
* **Aggie & Ignatius:** The receipt is standard white parchment, crisp and sharp. The printer jitters with a questioning click-clack. (80 pts)  
* **Loami:** The receipt is a rough, industrial-grade grey paper. The typewriter keys clunk like lead under his fingers, and the machine groans as it stamps his score. (50 pts)

### **The Gates (The Gilded Sentinels)**

To exit the Pavilion and enter the Academy proper, students must present their receipts to the **Harmony Wardens** guarding the massive brass-bound Spire Gates.

* **The Guards:** These sentinels have a distinct "Harmony-Sultan" vibe. They wear high-collared tunics of deep teal and white silk, overlaid with polished brass geometric breastplates. Their heads are adorned with high-crested, silk-wrapped helmets, and they hold long-poled "Vibration Halberds" that hum with the same teal energy as the gates. They move with statue-like, percussive discipline.  
* **The Interaction:** The guard takes the receipt, slides it into a brass reader on their belt, and if the light turns green, they strike the floor with their halberd, allowing the candidate to pass.

### **The First View: The Dual-Spire Anchorage**

As the PCs step through the gates, the iron bars swing open to reveal a sprawling garden courtyard—a pristine Oxford quadrangle that ends at a massive ocean cliffside.

* **The Twin Pillars of Harmony:** Flanking the central path are two titanic vessels docked on stone promontories. On the left, a gilded, vertical airship (**The Sky-Spire**) looms like a golden needle. On the right, a massive, black-hulled steam ship (**The Deep-Hull**) sits low in the water.  
* **The University Core:** Between the two ships, a magnificent stone university hall with gothic arches and stained glass rises up. It is a world of marble, brass piping, and glowing teal conduits.  
* **The Spire-Scape:** Beyond the garden, the air is filled with the skeletons of future buildings. Massive steam cranes and scaffolding towers climb toward the sky, hoisting entire prefabricated classroom wings into place with a thunderous *clack*.

# 🏛️ Scene 1: The Grand Assembly (The Indoctrination)

**Location:** The Oculus Auditorium (located within the Sky-Spire Core). A masterpiece of brass lattice and curved glass overlooking the uncharted clouds of Terra. Thousands of students are packed into vertical galleries, looking down at a small, illuminated stage.

**The "Lie":** Dean Isolde Vane steps to the podium in a crisp, high-collared white uniform. Her voice is amplified by floating brass "Whisper-Cones."

### **The Speech: "The New Horizon"**

"Citizens. Candidates. Look around you. You stand within a legacy built on the courage of those who dared to see the invisible. We are the inheritors of the Great Discovery—of noble houses like Sterling, Thorne, and Vance, who brought their unique energies into our Core, stitching together the very ground we walk upon for the benefit of all.

For eighty years, our maps have remained static. We have missed the thrill of the unknown, the wonder of meeting new peoples, and the vitality that comes from integrating new spirits into our Harmony. But that silence is over\! For the first time in nearly a century, a new frontier has been revealed\!

We welcome the Ash-bloods, whose mastery of heat brings a new fire to our Core. And we look with awe toward the Mizizi, whose Node boggles even our greatest minds—a resonance that holds death at bay\! Imagine the medicines, the longevity, the pure vitality we are about to stitch into our Core.

We are honored today by the presence of Captains Aris and Valerius, who charted these lands, and the diplomatic teams who have brought these peoples—officially, I am proud to announce—into the light of Harmony. Indeed, a Mizizi has already achieved the rank of Exploranaut and represents their lands at the Harmony Seat on our Great Council\!

Today, you follow in those footsteps. You are the needle. You are the thread. Go forth and find the glory that awaits us all\!"

* **The Insight:** (DC 15\) The Dean’s performance is flawless, but her hand grips the podium so hard the brass creaks. While the speech is a masterpiece of inspiration, there is a sense that the administration needs this class to succeed far more than they are admitting. The talk of "new energy" feels less like a choice and more like a desperate necessity.

# 🧬 Scene 2: Logistics & Dorm Assignments (The "Meat Grinder")

**The Chaos:** Following the speech, the "Sultan-Guard" Wardens use their vibration halberds to herd the 77,000 remaining students toward the **Modular District**. It is a stampede of brass trunks, shouting, and confusion.

### **The Assignment Interface**

At the gate of each dormitory block, a **Loom Kiosk** (typewriter/printer combo) is bolted to the stone.

* **Mechanic:** Students slide their Loom Receipt into a slot. The machine clatters, stamps the parchment, and spits out a brass key-tag.  
* **The Result:** The Loom assigns living quarters based on clannish resonance and nomenclature (Alphabetical). Squad pairing is deferred until after the first academic evaluation.

### **The Dorms**

* **Britt & Aggie (Block 04-Root):** A high-humidity modular unit built into a terraced cliff. The walls are covered in moss-textured insulation, and it smells faintly of damp earth.  
* **Iggy & Ignatius (Block 12-Basalt):** A low-humidity, high-thermal block. Because their names both start with "I," the Loom has bunked the Earthkin and the Ash-blood together. The room is hot, dry, and smells like a forge.  
* **Loami (Block 99-Piston):** Located in the "Industrial Overflow" wing near the Walker-Core. It’s a loud, vibrating space made of bare iron.

### **The Roommates (Block 99-Piston)**

Since Loami is separated from the others, he finds himself bunking with two "Technical Track" NPCs:

* **"Ratchet":** A Copper-rank cynic who has a prosthetic brass hand. He’s already taking apart a desk. *"Welcome to the boiler room, kid. Don't believe the Dean. This place isn't a school; it's a battery, and we're the acid."*  
* **"Soot":** A wide-eyed Rust-leaning student who is terrified of being "culled." He treats Loami like an expert because Loami actually knows how a wrench works.

### **The Guide: Celia Vance**

Celia acts as a floating "Compliance Proctor" for the high-variance wing. She appears in the doorways of the various blocks, checking logs.

* *"Celia:* "Candidates, the Loom has determined your current housing is optimal for stabilizing your base frequencies. Do not fraternize across blocks until the first bell. I've already filed three demerits for noise in Block 12\. Try to be... quieter."

# 🌃Scene 3: Nighttime Sandbox (The Spire-Scape)

**Theme:** Atlantis meets Treasure Planet. High Polish vs. Grimy Reality. **Context:** Post-Intake. The Squad is formed (alphabetically) but not yet tested.

## **🧬 Previous Context: Logistics & Dorms (Scene 2\)**

**The Dorms (Home Base):**

* **Britt & Aggie (Block 04-Root):** High-humidity, moss-insulated cliffside unit.  
* **Iggy & Ignatius (Block 12-Basalt):** High-thermal block. Hot, dry, smells of forge.  
* **Loami (Block 99-Piston):** Industrial Overflow. Loud vibrations. Roommates: **Ratchet** (Cynic) & **Soot** (Anxious).

## **🌅 Establishing Shot: The Golden Hour (Afternoon Free-Roam)**

**The Transition:** As the dorm assignments conclude, a massive, resonant **Steam-Whistle** blows from the Walker-Core, signaling the end of the "Construction Shift."

* **Visuals:** The sun begins to dip below the horizon of the new Terra, casting long, bruised purple shadows across the red rocks. For a moment, the entire Academy catches the light—the brass of the **Sky-Spire** flares blindingly gold, while the iron of the **Deep-Hull** turns a deep, cooling blue.  
* **The Shift Change:** The deafening *clank-clank-clank* of the steam cranes slows to a halt. The dust settles. In its place, the hum of the city takes over. Thousands of **Teal Magitek Lanterns** flicker to life along the scaffolded walkways, creating a floating constellation of lights against the darkening sky.  
* **Atmosphere:** The air changes from the smell of ozone and sweat to the scent of roasting meats, spiced cider, and exotic street food carted in by "Normals" hoping to make a coin off the hungry students. The tension of the intake breaks; the "Spire-Scape" transforms from a construction site into a bustling, neon-lit university town.

**GM Read-Aloud:** "The great pistons of the Walker-Core heave a final, exhausted sigh, venting a cloud of white steam that rolls through the streets like fog. The construction noise dies, replaced by music—lutes from the high balconies, drums from the lower decks. The streetlamps hum to life, painting the brass walkways in electric teal. You have survived the Intake. The night is yours."

### **📍 1\. The Common Areas (The Central Quad)**

**Vibe:** A festival of survivors.

* **Activity:** A massive bonfire. Harmony officials have provided "Safe-Flame" (a chemically stabilized fuel), but several Ash-blood students are gathered in a smaller circle, trying to summon a "True Spark."  
* **The Hook:** **Sarge (Squad 09\)** sits on a crate, his face a map of old burn scars. He’s meticulously cleaning a rusted bayonet.  
* **NPC Depth:**  
  * **Backstory:** A non-graduate scout who lost his entire squad to an "Ether-Leak" three years ago. He blamed the leadership and now must graduate to change their chances.  
  * **Bond:** His current "Expendable" squad. He feels a crushing, quiet responsibility for their survival.  
  * **Flaw:** Fatalism. He believes everyone is destined to "dissolve" eventually.  
  * **Motive:** To prevent more youngens from dying.  
* **Interaction:** If Ignatius approaches, Sarge notes the "Pure Obsidian" of his skin. *"You're the one from the Pilgrimage, right? Be careful with that fire, boy. Harmony doesn't like things they can't put out with a switch."*  
* **DM Tip:** Emphasize the visual contrast. The "Safe-Flame" casts no shadows, while the "True Spark" makes shadows dance. This subtle wrongness of Harmony tech is a key theme.  
* **Campaign Tie-In:** Sarge’s bayonet is made of "Pre-Stitch" steel. If asked, he mutters it's from a "Lost Node." This hints that Harmony has lost territory before, foreshadowing the "Dissolved Lands" they will visit later.

### **📍 2\. Academy Welcome Events (The Great Hall)**

**Vibe:** Boring official PR mixed with desperate hunger.

* **Activity:** A lecture titled *"The Ethics of Integration"* plays on loop. Most students are ignoring it in favor of the free cider and hard tack.  
* **The Hook:** **Lucky (Squad 09\)** is working the room. He’s wearing a stolen Gold-rank sash and telling a group of terrified Copper students that he can "influence the Loom" for the price of their dessert rations.  
* **NPC Depth:**  
  * **Backstory:** A street urchin from the Anchorage outskirts who pickpocketed a dead candidate's Loom Receipt to get into the intake.  
  * **Bond:** A younger sister living in the "Low-Bunks" whom he sends his extra rations to.  
  * **Flaw:** Pathological Grifter. He cannot stop the "hustle," even when it’s counter-productive.  
  * **Motive:** To "fake it 'til he makes it" into a comfortable administrative job where he doesn't have to bleed.  
* **Interaction:** If Loami catches him, Lucky doesn't panic. He winks. *"Hey, big man. You look like you know how the pipes work. You want in on the best bunk in the Deep-Hull? I just need a 'maintenance override' on Block 12."*  
* **DM Tip:** Lucky isn't just a grifter; he knows the maintenance tunnels better than the faculty. If the players befriend him here, he becomes a crucial contact for smuggling contraband (or people) later in the season.  
* **Campaign Tie-In:** The lecture glosses over "The Silent Era" (the 80-year gap in discovery). A successful History check reveals a gap in the timeline that the Dean is actively hiding.

### **📍 3\. Private Clubs (The Gilded Balconies)**

**Vibe:** High-society exclusion. Smells of lavender and money.

* **Activity:** The Sterling and Thorne families are hosting an "Aurum Mixer." The air smells of lavender and ozone.  
* **The Hook:** **Valerius Sterling (Squad 01\)** stands on the railing, looking down at the quad. Beside him, **Seraphina Vox** is using a crystal prism to "score" the resonance of students walking below.  
* **NPC Depth (Valerius):**  
  * **Backstory:** Scion of the Sterling family, groomed to lead the Venture. He has never actually touched dirt; his hands are magically calloused to look "rugged."  
  * **Bond:** The Sterling family reputation—he carries it like a heavy, gilded shield.  
  * **Flaw:** Narcissism. He cannot process the idea of someone being more "efficient" than him.  
  * **Motive:** To find a Node so massive it secures his father's seat on the High Council forever.  
* **NPC Depth (Seraphina):**  
  * **Backstory:** A musical prodigy who views the world as a symphony. She finds Harmony's industrial noises "physically painful."  
  * **Bond:** Her "Harmonic Tuning" kit; she treats the delicate crystal forks like children.  
  * **Flaw:** Aesthetic Elitism. She literally gets a migraine from "ugly" or "low-frequency" people.  
  * **Motive:** To record the "Primal Song" of a Shattered Node and ascend to Grand Maestro.  
* **Interaction:** Valerius spots Britt and Aggie. *"Look, Seraphina. The Loom is desperate. They're letting the Mycelium waddle into our auditoriums. I suppose even a garden needs fertilizer."* Seraphina laughs, a sound like glass breaking. *"Their aesthetic is... dissonant, Val. It hurts my eyes to even chart them."*  
* **DM Tip:** Getting into this area requires a disguise (Britt/Iggy) or a servant's uniform (Loami). It's a social stealth challenge.  
* **Campaign Tie-In:** If Aggie gets close, Seraphina's tuning fork reacts unexpectedly—humming a "perfect 5th" instead of dissonance. Seraphina looks confused. This hints that the Mizizi biology is naturally more "Harmonious" than the Academy admits, a key plot point for the Mizizi Node arc.

### **📍 4\. Clan Assistance & Integration (The Help Desk)**

**Vibe:** Overworked and underfunded.

* **Activity:** A small, overworked booth. A Mizizi student named **Kojo** is trying to explain "Geometric Syntax" to a group of confused Earthkin.  
* **The Hook:** **Pudge (Squad 09\)** is hovering near the back. He isn't there for the math; he’s realized the Mizizi bring "Life-Capsules" (concentrated nutrients) that Harmony doesn't track as food.  
* **NPC Depth (Pudge):**  
  * **Backstory:** Son of a farmer whose land was "stitched" into a industrial zone. He’s been hungry since he was six years old.  
  * **Bond:** His mother’s copper cooking spoon, which he carries in his boot.  
  * **Flaw:** Cowardice. He will betray almost anyone for a hot meal.  
  * **Motive:** To find a world with enough food that nobody ever has to fight for it.  
* **Interaction:** Pudge whispers to Aggie. *"You got any more of those 'Root-Chews'? I'll swap you a brass-knuckle for a handful. I'm literally starving. This 'Rust' ration is just sawdust and water."*  
* **DM Tip:** Kojo is overwhelmed. Helping him (Intellect check) earns a "Mizizi Translation Codex" item (useful for exams).  
* **Campaign Tie-In:** The "Life-Capsules" Pudge is stealing are actually dormant seeds. If planted, they grow instant cover. This serves as a tutorial on Mizizi bio-tech for the players.

### **📍 5\. The Great Library (The Forbidden Wing)**

**Vibe:** Silent, cold, and tense.

* **Activity:** Students are researching for the first exam. The air is deathly silent.  
* **The Hook:** A tall, gaunt Ash-blood scholar named **Pyrrhus** with white-hot eyes is arguing with a Librarian. He’s pointing to a map of the "Shattered Node Variant."  
* **NPC Depth:**  
  * **Backstory:** An ex-priest of the Emberkin who was banished for "Heresy" when he claimed the Ancestors were screaming for help.  
  * **Bond:** The "Living Flame" he carries in a specialized lantern—he says it's his father's soul.  
  * **Flaw:** Paranoia. He believes every Harmony official is trying to "snuff out" his light.  
  * **Motive:** To find the source of the heat-drain and stop Vumbua from "choking" the world.  
* **Interaction:** If Ignatius listens (Perception DC 14), Pyrrhus is frantic. *"The heat isn't fading\! It's being diverted\! Look at the ley-lines—they don't feed the city, they feed the Spire\!"* The Librarian signals two Wardens to escort him out.  
* **DM Tip:** The Librarian is a Construct who only responds to absolute silence. Speaking triggers a "Shushing Beam" (minor psychic damage).  
* **Campaign Tie-In:** Pyrrhus drops a map fragment when escorted out. It shows a "Heat Sink" located directly under the Dean’s office. This is a direct clue to the "Minimum" crisis and a potential mid-campaign heist location.

### **📍 6\. Sky-Spire Auditoriums (The Observation Deck)**

**Vibe:** Awe-inspiring views and military strategy.

* **Activity:** The massive telescopes are unlocked. Students can see the swirling, purple-and-teal chaos of the Terra below.  
* **The Hook:** **Cassius Thorne (Squad 01\)** is lecturing a group of subordinates on "Surgical Strike" points.  
* **NPC Depth:**  
  * **Backstory:** His grandfather was the General who "suppressed" the Ash-blood Uprising 30 years ago. He wants to finish the job.  
  * **Bond:** The Thorne Legion code—a black iron signet ring he never takes off.  
  * **Flaw:** Bloodlust. He views every interaction as a tactical encounter to be won or lost.  
  * **Motive:** To militarize the Venture and turn the new frontier into a Thorne protectorate.  
* **Interaction:** He makes eye-contact with Iggy. *"You Earthkin... you're dense. Good. When the drop-pods hit the crust, I'll need someone heavy to soak up the impact. Try not to crumble before the first week is out."*  
* **DM Tip:** Describe the "Shattered Nodes" below not as land, but as floating islands drifting apart. This reinforces the urgency of the "Stitching."  
* **Campaign Tie-In:** Cassius is marking "Bombardment Zones." One of them is the village where the players will likely go in Session 3\. This sets up the inevitable conflict between the players (explorers) and Squad 01 (conquerors).

### **📍 7\. Deep-Hull Decks (The Vents)**

**Vibe:** The underground gambling ring. Hot and greasy.

* **Activity:** Below the lecture halls, the "Real Academy" happens. Students are gambling on the outcome of the first exam.  
* **The Hook:** A group of older students (Year 3\) are taking bets on which Squad 7 variant will "Dissolve" first.  
* **Interaction:** Loami hears his name mentioned. *"5-to-1 on the Alpha-7 cluster. They've got the Mizizi cousins and the 'Trench-coat' Earthkin. That squad's a suicide pact waiting to happen."*  
* **DM Tip:** The gambling currency is "Chits" (Battery Charge). Players can actually wager here to gain starting resources, but losing means starting the exam with a disadvantage.  
* **Campaign Tie-In:** The betting book has a list of "Previous Squads." Almost all of them are crossed out. This reinforces the lethality of the job and gives Loami a tangible list of "Ghost Squads" to investigate later.

## **📅 Scene 4: The Speed-Run (The First Week)**

* **Monday:** "Cartography & The Lie of the Horizon."  
* **Tuesday:** "Harmonic Ethics: Why the Manual is Always Right."  
* **Wednesday:** "Practical Anchor Maintenance." (Loami shines).  
* **Thursday:** "Xenobiology: What to Kill and What to Stitch."  
* **Friday:** "The Calculus of Sacrifice."

## **📝 Scene 5: The First Exam (The Gauntlet)**

* **The Setup:** 77,000 students in **Simulation Pods**.  
* **The Stakes:** Top 1,000 to Sky-Spire; Bottom 20,000 Rusted out.  
* **Action:** Transition players to **Venture\_Exam\_Survey.md**.

### **End of Session 1\.**

# Script 1

This is a great note. You are right; the specific flavor of the "Teal Butlers" and the mechanics of the typewriter add so much texture to the setting.

Here is the **Revised Part 1**, restoring the GM’s descriptive text and the specific interactions with the "Rust" rejection and the Supervisor.

---

### **SCENE 1: THE INTAKE EXAM**

**INT. INTAKE PAVILION \- CUBICLES \- DAY**

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) So, the machine in front of you prints out that first question... all the way up until "Begin Intake." You didn't have to know how to use the typewriter. You just look down and say, "Okay, question number four is four." *Click.* Number three is three. *Click.*

(Beat) It prints out the rank... Gold, Silver, Copper, Rust. It cuts itself off and drops into your hand. A little flag pings up on the corner—*Ping\! Ping\!*—and suddenly an attendant is there to whisk you away. These attendants are running around in these teal butler ties... sort of somewhere between a Sultan and an English butler.

**GM (LUKE S)** (To Sophie) Britt, you would have finished your survey first. If you wanted to try to stall for Aggie to finish her test, you can. Otherwise, y'all are going to get pulled apart in the current.

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** I think I try to stall. Yeah. As I finish, the little flag automatically goes ding. Can I grab the flag and just like... hold it back down?

**GM (LUKE S)** (Describing the consequence) I think that you were able to get it down. But you can see someone... it's like the airport traffic guard. He's way down there on a point and he's walking to you. You can tell that you're going to be the next car that gets the whistle blown at you.

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** Can I try to rip my ticket off and shove it in my pocket and be like... "Something happened\! It didn't print\! Like the Bluetooth's not connected\!"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Attendant) "You finished your exam. Okay, this way, please come."

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** "No, it didn't print. It didn't print. Let me... I'm going to look under the table." (Action) I just get down and start looking underneath. Just shuffling around underneath the desk.

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Attendant) "Excuse me, ma'am. It really is time to go. This cubicle needs to be cleared for the next candidate."

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** "It didn't print\!" (Action) I think I stand up and my shell hits the desk and it knocks over the typewriter. Then I pull it out of my pocket and I say, "Oh, I found it."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Attendant) "Please... please follow me, ma'am."

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** I think I make eye contact with Aggie and I follow.

---

### **SCENE 2: THE WORKING MAN & THE CULL**

**INT. INTAKE PAVILION \- HALLWAY \- CONTINUOUS**

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) As you are working your way through, about one in five is being pulled in a different direction than you. Their flags went up... but the attendants aren't checking receipts until the end. It's like Costco—there’s two guys with a Sharpie checking it off. They are soldier types, wearing thicker jerkens wrapped in an intricate pattern.

**LOMI (LUKE F)** I think just during the general stroll... Lomi's talking with the guy. (In Character) "Hey, there's quite a lot of you here. How's your benefits? You all right? Everybody doing well? They paying you well here?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Attendant) "You are a Copper. It is always good to know your options. I hope you make it through the next round. Do you need a job?"

**LOMI (LUKE F)** "Ah, no. I got a life calling in the boiler room. Family born and raised. Boiler mega-union."

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating the background action) "Come on, sir. Your test is done. Please don't try it again. No, you can't. I'm sorry." (Narrating) You see a different colored attendant, slightly more bulky, come and grab a guy. The guy is just weeping as he gets pulled to the side. The attendant looks back at Lomi. (As Attendant) "Oh, sorry about that. Um... you're talking about boiling water?"

**LOMI (LUKE F)** "Yeah, you know, you are doing great work here and you keep doing your thing. I see you're very busy. Just want to make sure you're being taken care of."

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) He ducks as someone throws a hat off the tin. (As Attendant) "Oh gosh, um... thank you for your concern. If you have a God, please pray."

---

### **SCENE 3: IGGY'S CHAOS**

**INT. INTAKE PAVILION \- IGGY'S CUBICLE \- CONTINUOUS**

**IGGY (HOLLY)** I think Iggy is gonna ask... (In Character) "Sir... do you have a tissue? I could use a tissue."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Attendant) "No."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "That's okay. That's okay. I have an idea." (Action) He goes up to the receipt thing that's been printing and he just pulls down.

**GM (LUKE S)** Oh, no.

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "I got it. I got it. I have one more question. Where am I?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Attendant) "Oh god. That just dropped our throughput by 100 candidates. This is terrible." (As Supervisor) A taller figure starts working their way through the con. "Oh, um... that's my supervisor. Can you help me fix it? No, it's already gross. Oh, it's so gross." (Narrating) He's picking up slime off of the receipt generator.

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "But I don't know what this is."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Supervisor) "Does Iggy use his receipt at all?"

**IGGY (HOLLY)** No, no, he did not use his receipt.

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Supervisor) He waves and grabs Iggy by the arm. "Sir, this way towards the entrance. Welcome to Vumbua."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "Well, thank you so much. I do have questions."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Supervisor) "Good, good. That's what you're here for. Welcome to Curiosity."

---

### **SCENE 4: THE COURTYARD REVEAL**

**EXT. VUMBUA COURTYARD \- DAY**

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) You come through these large marble pillars into this huge courtyard. A monstrous ironclad cruise ship with brass fittings sits in a harbor. Next to it is a smaller version of it that has this airship balloon tied to it. The people are just so small compared to these vessels.

**GM (LUKE S)** (To John) Ignatius, you want to roll me something to see how the hell you're processing here? Because I don't think he's seen anything like this.

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** (Rolling) I think that... nine with Fear.

**GM (LUKE S)** Nine with Fear. I think Ignatius... there's kind of a lot going on here.

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** I think Ignatius had this facade of confidence walking in and getting through this, it just melts away. Like, "What the f\*\*\*?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As "Chad" Student) Coming right after you is a tall, nicely dressed, kind of Bridgerton-esque vibe but a little more meat on him. "Don't worry, Chad. It's so... welcome to the show, mate. Oh, wait, are you... from the Ashland Islands? The Ember Isles?"

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** "What gave it away? Was it the soot or the literal flames?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Chad) "Um, you are on fire, lad. Yes, it's back, right?" (Beat) "It's hard to wipe off. I mean, it's something that never leaves you. I... all respect. I hope not, actually. I'll see you." (Walking away, then turning) "Oh... will your hand burn me?"

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** "I don't think so." (Action) I shake his hand.

**GM (LUKE S)** It doesn't burn him. (As Chad) "Alright, jolly good." (Narrating) He storms off, spitting and trying to get the soot off his hand.

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** I think Ignatius finds this really funny because like... that's not a normal thing for him to always be covered in soot. It's just because of how far he's traveled. He plays into it every now and then. We're not barbarians. We clean ourselves.

---

### **SCENE 5: THE UNION MAN**

**EXT. VUMBUA COURTYARD \- CONSTRUCTION ZONE \- CONTINUOUS**

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) Lomi, you might have even seen some of the inside of Vumbua because you came across as part of the maintenance crew. It wouldn't be a huge surprise to you. But I think you're maybe a little bit proud? It is getting pretty close to holding students and it was just a boat and a ship like half a year ago.

**LOMI (LUKE F)** (Previously "Loami or Britt") I think he he's coming out and just looking around and going... (In Character) "Yeah, this will do. They do good work. You know? What can we say? It's a little more cushy than the Boiler Room. I'll say it. Doesn't take as much grit... but they do good work."

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) Lomi, you recognize someone. There is someone else who surprises you coming out of the exams. All you know him by is **Sarge**. You know him because the workers would have these campfires set up... the social hour. (As Sarge) He catches your eye. "Loaves? Loaves, we made it. Can you believe it?"

**LOMI (LUKE F)** "Hey, Sarge\! You made it in\! Hey, I was feeling pretty good about myself until I saw *you* come in, huh? They let anyone in here, huh?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Sarge) "Yeah. Yeah. I'll be honest. Barely cut it. Barely cut it. I didn't... I don't even know what I was talking about. The green flag popped up and I said, 'Alright, let's give this a go.'"

**LOMI (LUKE F)** "You always guess C, right? That's what they say."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Sarge) "Is that the third one? Yeah. I just looked at the typewriter. Seems about right. S\*\*\*, dude. It's kind of a lot going on. I don't know if I'm actually cut out for this."

**LOMI (LUKE F)** "You know, it is pretty overwhelming. I'll be honest. But we'll... we just give it our best shot. See what happens. You know, we always got something to go back to if it doesn't work out."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Sarge) "Yeah, you're right. I gotta remember why I'm here. Doing this for the lads."

---

### **SCENE 6: THE DEAN'S WELCOME**

**INT. THE GREAT HALL \- DAY**

The candidates are herded into a massive auditorium.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) The flow takes all of you across into this massive auditorium. It sits 10,000. It's mostly all from Harmony... you all are a quite a bit of a minority. Every time someone recognizes you're from a different place, it's like a minor celebrity status.

(Beat) After a few minutes, a small figure—if you've seen *Arcane*, think Professor Heimerdinger but a female version—bounces onto the stage. This is **Dean Isolde Vane**.

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Dean Isolde) "Hello students\! Hello candidates\! Hello potential adventurers\! I'm just so excited for this next class. It's going to be amazing. We, all of us, are the inheritors of great discovery\!" (Pacing frantically) "For 80 years... 80 years our maps have been static\! We've missed the thrill of adventure. No one's wanted to do it. I've been lonely, honestly. Not to say my thousand weren't great, but more is better\!"

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** (Previously "Loami or Britt") I think during this part of the speech, I whisper to Aggie. (In Character) "I don't trust this f\*\*\*ing guy."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Dean Isolde) "We've got Ash Bloods whose mastery of heat brings new fire to our Core\! We've got the Mizizi... who, well, we don't really know what they do, and that's amazing\! We don't know\! It's been so long since we could say that about anything\!"

(Beat) "But... unfortunately, we do have to lose another 20,000 of you by the end of the week. So, study hard. Listen to your professors. Welcome to Vumbua\!"

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) She pops back out from the curtain. "Oh\! I'm Dean. I'm Dean Isolde\! If you need me... well, I'm kind of busy." (Narrating) Then, an attendant comes out. For the Mizizi, you recognize **Rill** (The River-Born). She leans out, pulls the Dean back behind the curtain. She seems to have a very familiar relationship with the Dean. She waves good luck to you and goes in.

---

### **SCENE 7: THE TISSUE INCIDENT**

**INT. GREAT HALL EXIT \- CONTINUOUS**

The group is being herded out. Iggy (The Earthkin) is dripping wet and sneezing.

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "Hey... did you guys feel that? Is that... wind? What is that?"

**LOMI (LUKE F)** "Yeah. The door opened. We're getting directed out. Iggy. Ignatius. All right. I can remember that."

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) There is a little kid walking around to people. He's holding a little ball of fire. (As Lucky) "Hey you\! I'm **Lucky**. You need something? You let Lucky know. That guy's red hot hair? Look at it. Got it right here. Authentic. Probably an Ash Blood. Two gold pieces. Hot off the rock." (To Iggy) "You? I'm Lucky. I'm as tall as you are. Do you need more height? I can get it for you."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "No, I like my height. But I could use a Kleenex."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Lucky) "Oh, I knew it. I got just the thing for you." (Rummaging) He pulls out like... the turban that the guards were wearing. "I found this one just outside. I think it'll be nice. I'll give it to you for one gold."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "I got no money."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Lucky) "Hm. That's okay. You can be lucky today. I'll just give you the whole thing. But you... you're gonna be unlucky if you don't come back and find Lucky. And if you find something cool, I'm your guy."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "Thank you. Well, I *do* have something cool." (Action) He has his satchel of gizmos. "Are you interested in an invention?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Lucky) "Heck yeah. What do they do?"

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "This one makes noise... and that's it." (Action) He pulls out a very extravagant version of a trumpet-trombone instrument that unfolds like an accordion. It makes the most god-awful sound.

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Lucky) "Well... I'm pretty lucky, but I don't even know if I'm lucky enough to do something with that. I'll tell you what, I'll take it anyway. Hey, make sure that when that guy comes in here... he probably don't want to see you with that." (Narrating) Lucky bolts. A Guard comes in—absent his turban. Iggy is standing on a chair with the thing.

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Guard) "Hey, hey, hey\! You took my turban\!"

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "No, this is a Kleenex."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Guard) "No, that was... that goes... uh... I'm going to have to take it from you."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "I mean... I kind of need it, but here you go. Have a nice day." (Action) He hands back the snot-filled turban and just walks away.

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** Ignatius is just laughing his ass off. He grabs Lomi. "Let's go."

**LOMI (LUKE F)** "Yeah, let's get out of here. I'm definitely not feeling quite as lucky as that guy. Let's get lost."

---

Here is **Part 3** of the transcript, covering the **Dorm Assignments**, **Iggy’s Climbing Expedition**, and the introduction of **Serra Vox**.

I have continued to attribute "Loami or Britt" based on context:

* **Britt (Sophie):** Interacting with the crane, telling Iggy to come down, being suspicious/aggressive toward Serra.  
* **Lomi (Luke F):** Heading to Block 99, critiquing the bonfire construction.

---

### **SCENE 8: THE PUNCH CARDS**

**EXT. ACADEMY COURTYARD \- DAY**

The group exits the Great Hall. A machine prints out punch cards for housing assignments.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) You make your way towards the end of the aisle corridor. You pass by the machine, and it prints out a punch card for each of you. It drops into your hand.

(Reading Results) Iggy... Block 12\. Ignatius... Block 12\. Lomi... Block 99\. Britt and Aggie... Block 04\.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) The campus loops around in a big horseshoe. On the far side, there is a map. And there is a student with a bullhorn. (As Bullhorn Student) "Go to your rooms for tonight\! Tomorrow, your first class: Gen-Ed Exploration, 8:00 AM\! Sleep tight\! Tomorrow, first class\!"

**GM (LUKE S)** (To Sophie & Kristina) Britt and Aggie, I feel like y'all got out of the main room pretty quick. Do you go straight to the dorms to settle in, or do you go explore?

**AGGIE (VIA LUKE S)** I think now that people are spreading out, Aggie is a little less overwhelmed. Curiosity is growing. She wants to see more. At least do a lap around the buildings before going back.

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** (Previously "Loami or Britt") I think my instinct is definitely not to go to the dorm. I think I'm like... "We need to look around."

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) Okay. You see Greek Row... a posh club feel. You see the Clan Assistance Office. You see the huge library. Block 04, your dorm, is a modular unit built into a terraced cliff. It looks like a repurposed green room. Block 99 is a geothermal plant with steam coming out of it. And Block 12 is the classic dorms.

---

### **SCENE 9: THE DETOUR**

**EXT. ACADEMY HALLWAYS / COURTYARD \- CONTINUOUS**

**GM (LUKE S)** Ignatius and Lomi, would y'all have gone directly to your assigned rooms?

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** As soon as Ignatius finds out that Iggy—this little guy I had a short conversation with—is my roommate... he’s like, "Oh, I guess we're going to be bunkmates. Should we go to our room?" (In Character) "I guess we're going to go to our room now, right?"

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "I'm not going to the room."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** "Oh. Where... where are you going?"

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "I don't know. There's so much to see."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** "Yeah, but we have class tomorrow."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "Look. Class. I need to find out things. I'm just gonna walk around. You don't have to come."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** Ignatius is appalled. He was about to be a rule follower, and this little thing was like, "No." (Internal Monologue) *Who am I? All right.* (Action) Ignatius is just gonna follow the whims of Iggy for a little bit. He is less curious about the surroundings and more curious about... what is this little thing gonna do?

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) Iggy, where do your feet take you?

**IGGY (HOLLY)** He has his journal back out. He pulls some contraption out of his bag—a big magnifying glass that amplifies his already ginormous eyes. He is walking down every hallway, looking at everything, drawing the whole thing. It looks like a schizophrenic is taking notes. (In Character) "Oh, this is good. This is good. Oh... this is nothing." (Action) He hands Ignatius random things to hold while he inspects small details.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) You exit into the courtyard. There are cranes in the air dropping large loads of materials.

**IGGY (HOLLY)** I think he’s outside... and if there’s a crane, he’s trying to climb it. He wants the top vantage point to assess his surroundings.

---

### **SCENE 10: THE CRANE CLIMB**

**EXT. INDUSTRIAL ZONE \- CONTINUOUS**

**GM (LUKE S)** Britt and Aggie, you start making your way towards the industrial side. You see a man on fire looking up at a little creature who is halfway up a crane... just hanging by his feet.

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** (Previously "Loami or Britt") I think it's definitely a looking up and being like... "Huh. What's going on?" And then I think I say to Aggie... (In Character) "That looks promising. Come on." (Action) I head toward Iggy and Ignatius.

**GM (LUKE S)** (To Holly) Iggy, you get pretty high up. You've been above ground before, but never with *sky*. Are you looking up or down?

**IGGY (HOLLY)** I think... at some point, you can touch it, right? Like, I'm going to be able to touch the sky?

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** (Calling up) "I think you *are* touching it."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "No, but like... I don't feel it."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** "I didn't know you *could* feel it."

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** (Walking up) "Who is that? Come down. Come down\!"

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "Why? Why are you guys following me? Nobody ever follows me. I just need to see something."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** "I'm pretty sure you're my roommate."

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** I think Britt reaches out and starts to shake the scaffolding. (In Character) "Come down now."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "Hey, hey, hey\! What are you doing? Hold on. Hold on." (Action) In my mind, Iggy is trying to plot out the whole campus on a sheet. He wants a map. And he thinks he's going to be able to grab a cloud.

### **SCENE 11: ENTER Serra Vox**

**EXT. INDUSTRIAL ZONE \- CONTINUOUS**

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) As you are gathered around this crane, you see coming toward you a small woman. She is carrying a little notebook, all prim and proper. Very student-looking. (As Serra Vox) "Hi. Um, what are y'all doing? Do you know each other? Oh my god. Are you... are you from the Island? And are you Ash Blood? Three of you all in one group? Oh, what a splendorous occasion\!"

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** (Previously "Loami or Britt") "Take a photo. It'll last longer."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** Ignatius is just looking down like... "Huh? Is she talking to us?"

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** "Can we... can we help you? What do you need?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Serra) "Uh, well, I was going to invite you over to the Bonfire tonight. We're digging a hole and we're..."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "What's a bonfire?" (Action) He puts the notebook away and slides down the outside of the scaffolding.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) We see him disappear in a plume of dust, and then he’s just standing there. Impressive.

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Serra) "Oh my. Um... well, I just wanted to say hi and invite you." (She looks nervous of Britt) "I'm... I'm an ally. Is that okay to say?"

**AGGIE (VIA LUKE S)** "Don't mind my cousin. Hi, I'm Aggie."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Serra) "Hi. My name's Serra. Serra Vox." (She shakes Aggie's hand) "How are y'all settling in?"

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "I don't know. We just found these guys."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** Ignatius is gonna lean over to Britt and go... (Whispering) "I don't trust this b\*\*\*\*."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Serra) "I haven't seen anybody else who's not from Harmony except... well..." (She looks past them) "Are you also on fire? I can't tell."

---

**EXT. BLOCK 99 / BONFIRE PIT \- CONTINUOUS**

**GM (LUKE S)** Lomi is over there too. Lomi, you were going to the dorm?

**LOMI (LUKE F)** (Previously "Loami or Britt") He's going 99\. I'd say Lomi unintentionally gets to 99\. He sees the steam stacks and is like, "All right, here we go." And then he sees it's Building 99\.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) He sees Iggy drop out of the crane like a wrecking ball. He sees the Mizizi girls.

**LOMI (LUKE F)** He's seeing a crowd. He'll saddle up. (Action) He walks up to the bonfire pit where other candidates are throwing stuff in. (In Character) "So, you thinking you're going to use like an accelerant or something? Or we just going to go... what do we got? Straight lumber in there? What's the plan?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Student) "Oh, this is not the problem. We have it all masked out. Optimal flow. We get the light winds at the bottom... but, well, we don't have a source of flame yet. That is a problem."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** Ignatius is just going to sit there and not say a f\*\*\*ing thing.

**LOMI (LUKE F)** I think that's when Lomi looks over his shoulder. (In Character) "I think we can solve that." (Action) He starts walking over to Ignatius.

---

**SCENE 13: THE CAMPAIGN HOOKS (DEBRIEF)**

**INT. VIRTUAL TABLETOP \- NIGHT**

**GM (LUKE S)** (To the Group) The couple of things that I'd be interested to hear... what are the parts that are intriguing you the most? (Counting off options) It could be **Exploration**—the world is ready to be discovered. It could be **Politics**—figuring out what's going on at the Academy. It could be just doing really good in **Class** \[`1204-1205`\].

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** (Previously "Loami or Britt") I definitely think Britt's motivation is... I think **unintentionally she's very, very good in class**. But her main interest has always lied in: What are the **political ramifications** of the Academy? (Beat) And what is hiding below the surface? Because **something is**. \[`1205`\]

**GM (LUKE S)** Cool. Anybody else know or you still thinking about it? \[`1205`\]

**LOMI (LUKE F)** (Previously "Loami or Britt") I think for Lomi, it would be the **Transition**. From candidate to student, and then forming the party. How does that work? How do you get selected? (Beat) And then... what are the first steps out of the Academy? He is interested in this **newfound vigor for exploration**. \[`1205-1206`\]

**GM (LUKE S)** Cool. And Iggy?

**IGGY (HOLLY)** I think Iggy would be fine with whatever ends up giving him **Answers**. (Beat) Exploration sounds fun. But I don't know if the deep under-workings of what is going on are tied to the Academy, or if it's something you find out *outside* of the Academy. That would influence my answer. \[`1206`\]

---

### **Session 1 Prep: The Player Hooks**

Based on this specific conversation, here are the narrative levers you need to pull for Session 1:

1. **Britt (The Unintentional Ace):** Sophie explicitly stated Britt is "unintentionally very, very good in class" \[`1205`\].

   * *Session 1 Goal:* Give her a moment in the "Gen-Ed" scene where she answers a question correctly without trying, annoying the "Gold" NPCs (like Valerius or Calculus Prime) who actually studied. This frees her up to snoop on the **Politics**.  
2. **Lomi (The Process Guy):** Luke F is interested in the *mechanics* of the transition—"How do you get selected?" \[`1205`\].

   * *Session 1 Goal:* Make the "Squad Assignment" and the "Captain Interviews" feel bureaucratic and weighty. He wants to see the gears of the institution turning.  
3. **Iggy (The Data Hunter):** Holly is undecided on *where* the answers are (Inside vs. Outside) \[`1206`\].

   * *Session 1 Goal:* Present two distinct mysteries. One internal (Why is the power flickering?) and one external (What are those weird ships?). See which one Iggy chases.

# v3

# **Session 1: The Venture & The Vances**

**Theme:** Atlantis meets Treasure Planet. High Polish vs. Grimy Reality. **Core Conflict:** The "Savants" (PCs) vs. The "System" (The Aristocrats).

## **🏗️ Scene 0: The Intake (The Hangar Pavilion)**

**Atmosphere:** A sea of 100,000 bodies swarming the "Anchorage." The intake takes place within a cavernous, temporary iron-and-canvas vault known as **The Intake Pavilion**. This structure is massive, designed with high, vaulted ceilings that will eventually serve as the main hangars for the Academy's walkers and airships once the "Venture" begins.

**Visuals:** The air is thick with the smell of lamp oil, ozone, and the nervous sweat of 100,000 hopefuls. Above, worker-constructs crawl along the iron rafters, readying the fuel lines. The noise is a constant, vibrating thrum—the rhythmic *clank-clank-clank* of the city being assembled outside.

### **🖼️ GM Visual: The Intake Cubicle**

**Image Generation Prompt:**

A first-person view from inside a cramped, walled faux wood cubicle inside a cavernous industrial hangar. In the foreground, an antiquated black iron typewriter with the word "Vumbua" which has brass keys sits on a heavy metal desk. Above it, a strange, retro metal contraption mounted on the wall is spitting out a long, thin receipt paper. The lighting is a mix of smoky amber oil lamps. Aesthetic: 1920s bureaucracy meets high-fantasy steampunk, busy, overwhelming, cinematic lighting.

### **The Filtering Mechanic: "The Spire Scan"**

To progress toward the Academy gates, every student must first step into one of the hundreds of **Resonance Booths**.

* **The Process:** You aren't asked your name. You step into the booth, and a brass ring descends over you, humming with teal energy.  
* **The "Maintenance" Result:** If a student's heart rate spikes too high, or their "Aura" flickers into grey-static, the booth emits a firm, decisive tone.  
  * *The Guard:* "Candidate 88,210. Profile: **Infrastructure Support**. Report to the transport for City Maintenance assignment. The Venture needs strong foundations."  
  * *The Statistics:* \~22,419 candidates (20% of the intake) are reassigned here. It isn't a failure; it's a necessary placement in the engine of the city.

### **The Player Intake (The Receipt)**

As the PCs pass their scans, they are directed to heavy iron desks with antiquated typewriters.

* **The Input:** They type their profiles. The machine stamps a **Loom Receipt**—their only proof of existence.  
* **Britt & Iggy:** Gold-Flecked Paper (100 pts). The printer hums a melody.  
* **Aggie & Ignatius:** Standard White Parchment (80 pts). The printer jitters.  
* **Loami:** Rough, Industrial-Grade Grey Paper (50 pts). The machine groans.

### **The First View: The Dual-Spire Anchorage**

As they enter the main campus:

* **The Twin Pillars:** The gilded **Sky-Spire** (Command/Elite Dorms) and the black-iron **Deep-Hull** (Logistics/Classrooms) flank the central university hall.  
* **The Spire-Scape:** A chaotic forest of steam cranes hoisting prefab dorms into place. The city is being built in real-time around them.

## **🏛️ Scene 1: The Grand Assembly (The Indoctrination)**

**Location:** The Oculus Auditorium (located within the Sky-Spire Core). **The "Lie":** Dean Isolde Vane steps to the podium in a crisp, high-collared white uniform.

### **The Speech: "The New Horizon"**

"Citizens. Candidates. Look around you. We are the inheritors of the Great Discovery. For eighty years, our maps have remained static. We have missed the thrill of the unknown. But that silence is over\!

We welcome the Ash-bloods, whose mastery of heat brings a new fire to our Core. We look with awe toward the Mizizi, whose Node holds death at bay. But listen closely: **These are but the first two steps into a vast and forgotten world.**

The map is not empty, it is merely waiting. The math proves there are **Missing Variables** out there—Hidden Clans needed to close the circuit. You are the needle. You are the thread. Go forth and find what has been lost. Find the glory that awaits us all\!"

* **The Insight (DC 15):** The Dean’s performance is flawless, but her hand grips the podium so hard the brass creaks. She isn't driven by ego; she is driven by the terrifying weight of **responsibility**. She genuinely believes that if this class fails, the lights go out forever.

## **🧬 Scene 2: Logistics & Dorm Assignments**

**The Chaos:** "Sultan-Guard" Wardens herd the 77,000 remaining students toward the **Modular District**.

### **The Assignment Interface**

At the gate of each dormitory block, a **Loom Kiosk** (typewriter/printer combo) is bolted to the stone.

* **The Result:** The Loom assigns living quarters based on clannish resonance and nomenclature (Alphabetical). Squad pairing is deferred until after the first academic evaluation.

### **The Dorms**

* **Britt & Aggie (Block 04-Root):** A high-humidity modular unit built into a terraced cliff. The walls are covered in moss-textured insulation, and it smells faintly of damp earth.  
* **Iggy & Ignatius (Block 12-Basalt):** A low-humidity, high-thermal block. Because their names both start with "I," the Loom has bunked the Earthkin and the Ash-blood together. The room is hot, dry, and smells like a forge.  
* **Loami (Block 99-Piston):** Located in the "Industrial Overflow" wing near the Walker-Core. It’s a loud, vibrating space made of bare iron.

### **The Roommates (Block 99-Piston)**

Since Loami is separated from the others, he finds himself bunking with two "Technical Track" NPCs:

* **"Ratchet":** A Copper-rank cynic who has a prosthetic brass hand. *"Welcome to the boiler room, kid. Don't believe the Dean. This place isn't a school; it's a battery, and we're the acid."*  
* **"Soot":** A wide-eyed Rust-leaning student who is terrified of being "culled." He treats Loami like an expert because Loami actually knows how a wrench works.

## **🌃 Scene 3: The First Night Sandbox (The Glitch)**

**The Event:** Midway through the night, the **Sky-Spire Lights Flicker**. A low, grinding groan echoes through the hull of the city. For 10 seconds, the "Safe-Flame" bonfires turn blue, then sputter. It is a "Brownout"—the first sign of the Minimum.

### **📍 Key Locations & Rival Hooks**

1. **The Common Areas (The Central Quad):**  
   * **The Hook:** **Sarge (Squad 09\)** barely flinches at the brownout. He is methodically checking the seals on a stack of ration crates.  
   * **Interaction:** He warns Ignatius, not with malice, but with exhausted seriousness: *"See that flicker? That's what happens when you lose control. Your fire is powerful, son, but if you can't contain it, you endanger the ship. I won't let another crew burn because of a 'Variance' error."* (Theme: Responsibility vs. Power).  
2. **Academy Welcome Events (The Great Hall):**  
   * **The Hook:** **Lucky (Squad 09\)** is using the blackout confusion to "redistribute" supplies.  
   * **Interaction:** He bumps into Loami. *"Easy there, big man. Power's spotty. The Academy wastes so much, doesn't it? I'm just making sure these rations get to the people who actually turn the wrenches. You want in?"* (Theme: Resourcefulness vs. Rules).  
3. **Private Clubs (The Gilded Balconies):**  
   * **The Hook:** **Valerius Sterling (Squad 01\)** watches the flicker with a frown, making notes on a data-slate.  
   * **Interaction:** He spots Britt/Aggie. *"Entropy is the enemy. Chaos—like that flicker, or your... informal attire—invites the Ether in. The Academy is built on Order because Order survives. Do try to keep up."* (Theme: Order vs. Chaos).  
4. **The Great Library (The Forbidden Wing):**  
   * **The Hook:** **Pyrrhus (Ash-blood)** is in the map room, tracing a line on a chart.  
   * **Interaction:** If Ignatius checks the map, he sees Pyrrhus has circled a spot in the ocean labelled **"The Trench."** Pyrrhus whispers: *"The heat isn't disappearing. It's draining... down."*  
5. **Sky-Spire Auditoriums (The Observation Deck):**  
   * **The Hook:** **Cassius Thorne** (Squad 01\) is lecturing subordinates on "Bombardment Zones."  
   * **Interaction:** He eyes Iggy. *"You Earthkin... you're dense. Good. When the drop-pods hit the crust, I'll need someone heavy to soak up the impact. Try not to crumble."*  
6. **Deep-Hull Decks (The Betting Ring):**  
   * **The Hook:** Older students are looking for "High Variance" bets.  
   * **Interaction:** Loami hears: *"10-to-1 **Captain Scorch** takes the Ash-blood kid. He loves the fire-types. But **Professor Ink**? He's looking for weirdos. Put 5 chits on him taking the Earthkin."*  
7. **The Cliffside (Iggy’s Moment):**  
   * **The Hook:** During the brownout, **Iggy** feels a sudden, sharp tremor in the earth—not a machine vibration, but a *geological* signal. It feels like a heartbeat from deep below the crust.  
   * **The Risk:** His "Trench-Kin" physiology reacts involuntarily—his goggles fog up with pressurized steam. He has to hide it before a passing Warden notices he isn't human.

## **📅 Scene 4: The Speed-Run (The First Week)**

*Montage of 12-hour days. The Professors are demanding, but driven by the need for competence.*

* **Monday:** "Cartography." Professor Hesperus shouts: *"The map is a lie\! Draw what you see, not what you expect\!"*  
* **Wednesday:** "Anchor Maintenance." Loami fixes a jammed valve that baffled the instructor.  
* **Friday:** "The Calculus of Sacrifice." A lecture on command ethics. *"Sometimes, to save the mission data, you must cut the line. It isn't cruelty; it's the math of survival."*

## **📝 Scene 5: The First Exam (The Gauntlet)**

**The Setup:** The 77,000 students back in the Hangar. The desks are gone. In their place are thousands of brass **Simulation Pods**.

**The Stakes:**

* **Top 1,000 (Gold):** Sky-Spire Dorms & Elite Captains.  
* **Middle Pack (Silver/Copper):** Standard Berths.  
* **Bottom 5,000:** "Rusted Out" (Reassigned to City Maintenance).

**Action:** Transition players to **Venture\_Exam\_Survey.md**.

# v2

# **Session 1: The Venture & The Vances**

**Theme:** Atlantis meets Treasure Planet. High Polish vs. Grimy Reality. **Core Conflict:** The "Savants" (PCs) vs. The "System" (The Aristocrats).

## **🏗️ Scene 0: The Intake (The Hangar Pavilion)**

**Atmosphere:** A sea of 100,000 bodies swarming the "Anchorage." The intake takes place within a cavernous, temporary iron-and-canvas vault known as **The Intake Pavilion**. This structure is massive, designed with high, vaulted ceilings that will eventually serve as the main hangars for the Academy's walkers and airships once the "Venture" begins. For now, it is a maze of velvet ropes, brass railings, and thousands of percussive typewriter stations.

**Visuals:** The air is thick with the smell of lamp oil, ozone, and the nervous sweat of 100,000 hopefuls. Above, worker-constructs crawl along the iron rafters, readying the fuel lines and docking clamps that will replace the intake desks in mere days. The noise is a constant, vibrating thrum—the rhythmic "clank-clank-clank" of the city being assembled outside, echoing within the hollow iron shell of the Pavilion.

### **The Filtering Mechanic: "The Spire Scan"**

To progress toward the Academy gates, every student must first step into one of the hundreds of **Resonance Booths** lining the Pavilion walls.

* **The Process:** You aren't asked your name. You step into the booth, and a brass ring descends over you, humming with teal energy.  
* **The Psychology:** As the ring passes your heart, the Loom triggers a "Micro-Dissolve." For one second, your body feels like it’s made of static.  
* **The "Rust" Result:** If a student's heart rate spikes too high, or their "Aura" flickers into grey-static, the booth emits a low, mournful foghorn blast.  
  * *The Guard:* "Candidate 88,210. Standing: RUST. Access Denied. Return to the transport for City Maintenance reassignment."  
  * *The Statistics:* \~22,419 candidates (20% of the intake) fail here. Their adventure ends at the very first gate.

### **The Player Intake (The Receipt)**

As the PCs pass their scans, they are directed to heavy iron desks bolted to the floor. On each sits an antiquated, 1920s-style typewriter with brass keys.

* **The Input:** They type their profiles into the lead-heavy keys. As they finish, a small, high-speed machine next to the typewriter chugs out a narrow, stiff strip of parchment—their **Loom Receipt**. This is their only proof of existence within the Academy.  
* **Britt & Iggy:** The receipt is printed on gold-flecked paper. The printer hums a melodic sequence. (100 pts)  
* **Aggie & Ignatius:** The receipt is standard white parchment, crisp and sharp. The printer jitters with a questioning click-clack. (80 pts)  
* **Loami:** The receipt is a rough, industrial-grade grey paper. The typewriter keys clunk like lead under his fingers, and the machine groans as it stamps his score. (50 pts)

### **The Gates (The Gilded Sentinels)**

To exit the Pavilion and enter the Academy proper, students must present their receipts to the **Harmony Wardens** guarding the massive brass-bound Spire Gates.

* **The Guards:** These sentinels have a distinct "Harmony-Sultan" vibe. They wear high-collared tunics of deep teal and white silk, overlaid with polished brass geometric breastplates. Their heads are adorned with high-crested, silk-wrapped helmets, and they hold long-poled "Vibration Halberds" that hum with the same teal energy as the gates. They move with statue-like, percussive discipline.  
* **The Interaction:** The guard takes the receipt, slides it into a brass reader on their belt, and if the light turns green, they strike the floor with their halberd, allowing the candidate to pass.

### **The First View: The Dual-Spire Anchorage**

As the PCs step through the gates, the iron bars swing open to reveal a sprawling garden courtyard—a pristine Oxford quadrangle that ends at a massive ocean cliffside.

* **The Twin Pillars of Harmony:** Flanking the central path are two titanic vessels docked on stone promontories. On the left, a gilded, vertical airship (**The Sky-Spire**) looms like a golden needle. On the right, a massive, black-hulled steam ship (**The Deep-Hull**) sits low in the water.  
* **The University Core:** Between the two ships, a magnificent stone university hall with gothic arches and stained glass rises up. It is a world of marble, brass piping, and glowing teal conduits.  
* **The Spire-Scape:** Beyond the garden, the air is filled with the skeletons of future buildings. Massive steam cranes and scaffolding towers climb toward the sky, hoisting entire prefabricated classroom wings into place with a thunderous *clack*.

## **🏛️ Scene 1: The Grand Assembly (The Indoctrination)**

**Location:** The Oculus Auditorium (located within the Sky-Spire Core). A masterpiece of brass lattice and curved glass overlooking the uncharted clouds of Terra. Thousands of students are packed into vertical galleries, looking down at a small, illuminated stage.

**The "Lie":** Dean Isolde Vane steps to the podium in a crisp, high-collared white uniform. Her voice is amplified by floating brass "Whisper-Cones."

### **The Speech: "The New Horizon"**

"Citizens. Candidates. Look around you. You stand within a legacy built on the courage of those who dared to see the invisible. We are the inheritors of the Great Discovery—of noble houses like Sterling, Thorne, and Vance, who brought their unique energies into our Core, stitching together the very ground we walk upon for the benefit of all.

For eighty years, our maps have remained static. We have missed the thrill of the unknown, the wonder of meeting new peoples, and the vitality that comes from integrating new spirits into our Harmony. But that silence is over\! For the first time in nearly a century, a new frontier has been revealed\!

We welcome the Ash-bloods, whose mastery of heat brings a new fire to our Core. We look with awe toward the Mizizi, whose Node holds death at bay. But listen closely: **These are but the first two steps into a vast and forgotten world.**

The map is not empty, it is merely waiting. There are rumors of other powers, other ways of life hidden in the mist. We are not just building a city; we are weaving a new tapestry of existence. You are the needle. You are the thread. Go forth and find what has been lost. Find the glory that awaits us all\!"

* **The Insight:** (DC 15\) The Dean’s performance is flawless, but her hand grips the podium so hard the brass creaks. While the speech is a masterpiece of inspiration, there is a sense that the administration needs this class to succeed far more than they are admitting. The talk of "new energy" feels less like a choice and more like a desperate necessity.

## **🧬 Scene 2: Logistics & Dorm Assignments (The "Meat Grinder")**

**The Chaos:** Following the speech, the "Sultan-Guard" Wardens use their vibration halberds to herd the 77,000 remaining students toward the **Modular District**. It is a stampede of brass trunks, shouting, and confusion.

### **The Assignment Interface**

At the gate of each dormitory block, a **Loom Kiosk** (typewriter/printer combo) is bolted to the stone.

* **Mechanic:** Students slide their Loom Receipt into a slot. The machine clatters, stamps the parchment, and spits out a brass key-tag.  
* **The Result:** The Loom assigns living quarters based on clannish resonance and nomenclature (Alphabetical). Squad pairing is deferred until after the first academic evaluation.  
* **The Dorms:**  
  * **Britt & Aggie (Block 04-Root):** A high-humidity modular unit built into a terraced cliff. The walls are covered in moss-textured insulation, and it smells faintly of damp earth.  
  * **Iggy & Ignatius (Block 12-Basalt):** A low-humidity, high-thermal block. Because their names both start with "I," the Loom has bunked the Earthkin and the Ash-blood together. The room is hot, dry, and smells like a forge.  
  * **Loami (Block 99-Piston):** Located in the "Industrial Overflow" wing near the Walker-Core. It’s a loud, vibrating space made of bare iron.

### **The Roommates (Block 99-Piston)**

Since Loami is separated from the others, he finds himself bunking with two "Technical Track" NPCs:

* **"Ratchet":** A Copper-rank cynic who has a prosthetic brass hand. He’s already taking apart a desk. *"Welcome to the boiler room, kid. Don't believe the Dean. This place isn't a school; it's a battery, and we're the acid."*  
* **"Soot":** A wide-eyed Rust-leaning student who is terrified of being "culled." He treats Loami like an expert because Loami actually knows how a wrench works.

### **The Guide: Celia Vance**

Celia acts as a floating "Compliance Proctor" for the high-variance wing. She appears in the doorways of the various blocks, checking logs.

* *"Celia:* "Candidates, the Loom has determined your current housing is optimal for stabilizing your base frequencies. Do not fraternize across blocks until the first bell. I've already filed three demerits for noise in Block 12\. Try to be... quieter."

## **🌃 Scene 3: The First Night Sandbox (Exploring the Spire-Scape)**

With the first day of Gen-Ed classes looming, the Academy hosts a "Welcome Night." The city is a neon-teal blur of ley-lines and lanterns. This is the first time the PCs can ignore their dorm assignments and find each other in the crowd.

### **📍 Key Locations & Rival Hooks**

1. **The Common Areas (The Central Quad):**  
   * **Activity:** A massive bonfire. Harmony officials have provided "Safe-Flame" (a chemically stabilized fuel), but several Ash-blood students are gathered in a smaller circle, trying to summon a "True Spark."  
   * **The Hook:** **Sarge (Squad 09\)** sits on a crate, his face a map of old burn scars. He’s meticulously cleaning a rusted bayonet.  
   * **NPC Depth:**  
     * **Backstory:** A former grunt who watched his entire crew die because an arrogant Exploranaut pushed too hard into a Shattered Node. He survived, but he refuses to let it happen again.  
     * **Bond:** His current "Expendable" squad. He feels a crushing, quiet responsibility for their survival.  
     * **Flaw:** Deep Distrust of Command. He struggles to follow orders from "Golden" officers who haven't bled.  
     * **Motive:** To finally graduate and lead his own crew so he can stop idiots from getting good soldiers killed.  
   * **Interaction:** If Ignatius approaches, Sarge notes the "Pure Obsidian" of his skin. *"You're the one from the Pilgrimage, right? Be careful with that fire, boy. Harmony doesn't like things they can't put out with a switch."*  
   * **DM Tip:** Emphasize the visual contrast. The "Safe-Flame" casts no shadows, while the "True Spark" makes shadows dance. This subtle wrongness of Harmony tech is a key theme.  
   * **Campaign Tie-In:** Sarge’s bayonet is made of "Pre-Stitch" steel. If asked, he mutters it's from a "Lost Node." This hints that Harmony has lost territory before, foreshadowing the "Dissolved Lands" they will visit later.  
2. **Academy Welcome Events (The Great Hall):**  
   * **Activity:** A lecture titled *"The Ethics of Integration"* plays on loop. Most students are ignoring it in favor of the free cider and hard tack.  
   * **The Hook:** **Lucky (Squad 09\)** is working the room. He’s wearing a gaudy gold-colored sash—pure theater, relying on the fact that fresh recruits don't know only the Loom Receipts are official—and telling a group of terrified Copper students that he can "influence the Loom" for the price of their dessert rations.  
   * **NPC Depth:**  
     * **Backstory:** A street urchin from the Anchorage outskirts who pickpocketed a dead candidate's Loom Receipt to get into the intake.  
     * **Bond:** A younger sister living in the "Low-Bunks" whom he sends his extra rations to.  
     * **Flaw:** Pathological Grifter. He cannot stop the "hustle," even when it’s counter-productive.  
     * **Motive:** To "fake it 'til he makes it" into a comfortable administrative job where he doesn't have to bleed.  
   * **Interaction:** If Loami catches him, Lucky doesn't panic. He winks. *"Hey, big man. You look like you know how the pipes work. You want in on the best bunk in the Deep-Hull? I just need a 'maintenance override' on Block 12."*  
   * **DM Tip:** Lucky isn't just a grifter; he knows the maintenance tunnels better than the faculty. If the players befriend him here, he becomes a crucial contact for smuggling contraband (or people) later in the season.  
   * **Campaign Tie-In:** The lecture glosses over "The Silent Era" (the 80-year gap in discovery). A successful History check reveals a gap in the timeline that the Dean is actively hiding.  
3. **Private Clubs (The Gilded Balconies):**  
   * **Activity:** The Sterling and Thorne families are hosting an "Aurum Mixer." The air smells of lavender and ozone.  
   * **The Hook:** **Valerius Sterling (Squad 01\)** stands on the railing, looking down at the quad. Beside him, **Seraphina Vox** is using a crystal prism to "score" the resonance of students walking below.  
   * **NPC Depth (Valerius):**  
     * **Backstory:** Scion of the Sterling family, groomed to lead the Venture. He has never actually touched dirt; his hands are magically calloused to look "rugged."  
     * **Bond:** The Sterling family reputation—he carries it like a heavy, gilded shield.  
     * **Flaw:** Narcissism. He cannot process the idea of someone being more "efficient" than him.  
     * **Motive:** To find a Node so massive it secures his father's seat on the High Council forever.  
   * **NPC Depth (Seraphina):**  
     * **Backstory:** A musical prodigy who views the world as a symphony. She finds Harmony's industrial noises "physically painful."  
     * **Bond:** Her "Harmonic Tuning" kit; she treats the delicate crystal forks like children.  
     * **Flaw:** Aesthetic Elitism. She literally gets a migraine from "ugly" or "low-frequency" people.  
     * **Motive:** To record the "Primal Song" of a Shattered Node and ascend to Grand Maestro.  
   * **Interaction:** Valerius spots Britt and Aggie. *"Look, Seraphina. The Loom is desperate. They're letting the Mycelium waddle into our auditoriums. I suppose even a garden needs fertilizer."* Seraphina laughs, a sound like glass breaking. *"Their aesthetic is... dissonant, Val. It hurts my eyes to even chart them."*  
   * **DM Tip:** Getting into this area requires a disguise (Britt/Iggy) or a servant's uniform (Loami). It's a social stealth challenge.  
   * **Campaign Tie-In:** If Aggie gets close, Seraphina's tuning fork reacts unexpectedly—humming a "perfect 5th" instead of dissonance. Seraphina looks confused. This hints that the Mizizi biology is naturally more "Harmonious" than the Academy admits, a key plot point for the Mizizi Node arc.  
4. **Clan Assistance & Integration (The Help Desk):**  
   * **Activity:** A small, overworked booth. A Mizizi student named **Kojo** is trying to explain "Geometric Syntax" to a group of confused Earthkin.  
   * **NPC Depth:**  
     * **Backstory:** The first Mizizi student to ever score Gold on the entry exam, but he was demoted to Silver after "administrative errors" by the Vanes.  
     * **Bond:** A tiny bioluminescent seed from his home village that he keeps in a glass vial around his neck.  
     * **Flaw:** Social Paralysis. He freezes up when the city noise gets too loud.  
     * **Motive:** To prove that Mizizi "Root-Logic" is more stable than Harmony's "Brass-Science."  
   * **The Hook:** **Pudge (Squad 09\)** is hovering near the back. He isn't there for the math; he’s realized the Mizizi bring "Life-Capsules" (concentrated nutrients) that Harmony doesn't track as food.  
   * **NPC Depth (Pudge):**  
     * **Backstory:** Son of a farmer whose land was "stitched" into a industrial zone. He’s been hungry since he was six years old.  
     * **Bond:** His mother’s copper cooking spoon, which he carries in his boot.  
     * **Flaw:** Cowardice. He will betray almost anyone for a hot meal.  
     * **Motive:** To find a world with enough food that nobody ever has to fight for it.  
   * **Interaction:** Pudge whispers to Aggie. *"You got any more of those 'Root-Chews'? I'll swap you a brass-knuckle for a handful. I'm literally starving. This 'Rust' ration is just sawdust and water."*  
   * **DM Tip:** Kojo is overwhelmed. Helping him (Intellect check) earns a "Mizizi Translation Codex" item (useful for exams).  
   * **Campaign Tie-In:** The "Life-Capsules" Pudge is stealing are actually dormant seeds. If planted, they grow instant cover. This serves as a tutorial on Mizizi bio-tech for the players.  
5. **The Great Library (The Forbidden Wing):**  
   * **Activity:** Students are researching for the first exam. The air is deathly silent.  
   * **The Hook:** A tall, gaunt Ash-blood scholar named **Pyrrhus** with white-hot eyes is arguing with a Librarian. He’s pointing to a map of the "Shattered Node Variant."  
   * **NPC Depth:**  
     * **Backstory:** An ex-priest of the Emberkin who was banished for "Heresy" when he claimed the Ancestors were screaming for help.  
     * **Bond:** The "Living Flame" he carries in a specialized lantern—he says it's his father's soul.  
     * **Flaw:** Paranoia. He believes every Harmony official is trying to "snuff out" his light.  
     * **Motive:** To find the source of the heat-drain and stop Vumbua from "choking" the world.  
   * **Interaction:** If Ignatius listens (Perception DC 14), Pyrrhus is frantic. *"The heat isn't fading\! It's being diverted\! Look at the ley-lines—they don't feed the city, they feed the Spire\!"* The Librarian signals two Wardens to escort him out.  
   * **DM Tip:** The Librarian is a Construct who only responds to absolute silence. Speaking triggers a "Shushing Beam" (minor psychic damage).  
   * **Campaign Tie-In:** Pyrrhus drops a map fragment when escorted out. It shows a "Heat Sink" located directly under the Dean’s office. This is a direct clue to the "Minimum" crisis and a potential mid-campaign heist location.  
6. **Sky-Spire Auditoriums (The Observation Deck):**  
   * **Activity:** The massive telescopes are unlocked. Students can see the swirling, purple-and-teal chaos of the Terra below.  
   * **The Hook:** **Cassius Thorne (Squad 01\)** is lecturing a group of subordinates on "Surgical Strike" points.  
   * **NPC Depth:**  
     * **Backstory:** His grandfather was the General who "suppressed" the Ash-blood Uprising 30 years ago. He wants to finish the job.  
     * **Bond:** The Thorne Legion code—a black iron signet ring he never takes off.  
     * **Flaw:** Bloodlust. He views every interaction as a tactical encounter to be won or lost.  
     * **Motive:** To militarize the Venture and turn the new frontier into a Thorne protectorate.  
   * **Interaction:** He makes eye-contact with Iggy. *"You Earthkin... you're dense. Good. When the drop-pods hit the crust, I'll need someone heavy to soak up the impact. Try not to crumble before the first week is out."*  
   * **DM Tip:** Describe the "Shattered Nodes" below not as land, but as floating islands drifting apart. This reinforces the urgency of the "Stitching."  
   * **Campaign Tie-In:** Cassius is marking "Bombardment Zones." One of them is the village where the players will likely go in Session 3\. This sets up the inevitable conflict between the players (explorers) and Squad 01 (conquerors).  
7. **Deep-Hull Decks (The Vents):**  
   * **Activity:** Below the lecture halls, the "Real Academy" happens. Students are gambling on the outcome of the first exam.  
   * **The Hook:** A group of older students (Year 3\) are taking bets on which Squad 7 variant will "Dissolve" first.  
   * **Interaction:** Loami hears his name mentioned. *"5-to-1 on the Alpha-7 cluster. They've got the Mizizi cousins and the 'Trench-coat' Earthkin. That squad's a suicide pact waiting to happen."*  
   * **DM Tip:** The gambling currency is "Chits" (Battery Charge). Players can actually wager here to gain starting resources, but losing means starting the exam with a disadvantage.  
   * **Campaign Tie-In:** The betting book has a list of "Previous Squads." Almost all of them are crossed out. This reinforces the lethality of the job and gives Loami a tangible list of "Ghost Squads" to investigate later.

## **📅 Scene 4: The Speed-Run (The First Week)**

*The GM should narrate a montage of the week's grueling schedule. Every day is 12 hours of "Integrated Reality" theory followed by 4 hours of physical drills.*

* **Monday:** "Cartography & The Lie of the Horizon." (Taught by a blind navigator).  
* **Tuesday:** "Harmonic Ethics: Why the Manual is Always Right."  
* **Wednesday:** "Practical Anchor Maintenance." (Loami shines here; the Vances look disgusted by the grease).  
* **Thursday:** "Xenobiology: What to Kill and What to Stitch."  
* **Friday:** "The Calculus of Sacrifice." (A grim lecture on how to calculate if a squadmate is worth saving based on their point value).

## **📝 Scene 5: The First Exam (The Gauntlet)**

**The Setup:** The 77,000 students are marched back into the **Intake Hangar**. The desks are gone. In their place are thousands of brass **Simulation Pods**.

* **The Hook:** The proctor announces: *"The top 1,000 scorers today will move into the Sky-Spire luxury dorms. The bottom 5,000 will be Rusted out by sunset. Begin."*  
* **The Result:** Only after the scores are tallied and the final bell rings does the Loom announce the formal squad designations. **Squad 7-Alpha** is officially formed.  
* **Action:** Transition players to **Venture\_Exam\_Survey.md**.

### **End of Session 1\.**

# Tab 24

This is a vital tonal pivot. Moving away from the "Dystopian/Oppressive" trope and toward "Scientific Romance/Tragic History" aligns perfectly with the *Atlantis* and *Arcane* inspirations you cited. It turns the campaign into a puzzle to be solved rather than a regime to be toppled.

Here is the **Vumbua Academy World Codex (v2.0)**, reorganized to reflect this "Hope vs. Entropy" framework.

---

# **VUMBUA ACADEMY CODEX: The Age of Stitching**

### **I. Core Philosophy: The Scientific Romance**

The central conflict is not "Empire vs. Rebels." It is **Survival vs. Entropy**.

* **The World is Broken:** The world is not a natural wilderness being colonized; it is a **Shattered Empire** that has drifted apart over 10,000 years.  
* **The Threat is Physics:** The "Ether" (Static/Void) is eating the edges of reality because the "circuit" is open. The world is running out of charge.  
* **Harmony is the Architect:** Harmony isn't trying to conquer the Clans; it is frantically trying to **reconnect** them before the lights go out forever. They are the "Electricians" of a dying universe.

---

### **II. The Coming Crisis: The Minimum**

* **What it is:** A mathematical certainty. The Empire’s energy reserves have dipped right to critical mass. The flickering lights aren't a sign of budget cuts; they are a sign of metaphysical starvation.  
* **The Academy’s Goal:** Vumbua Academy wasn't deployed to conquer the Ash-Bloods or Mizizi; it was navigated here because these are the only two "Live Nodes" left.  
* **The Dean’s Burden:** **Dean Isolde Vane** is not a villain hiding a secret; she is a scientist holding back panic. She keeps "The Minimum" secret to prevent civil unrest, believing she can solve the equation before the populace realizes the batteries are empty \[`846`, `850`\].

---

### **III. The Factions: Bias, Not Malice**

#### **1\. The Harmony Empire (The Integrators)**

* **Motivation:** **Order & Connectivity.** They believe that isolation leads to "The Bleed" (Dissolution). They respect the Clans’ power but are frustrated by their refusal to "plug in."  
* **The "Aristocrats" (Gold Tier):** They aren't evil; they are **Dogmatic**. Characters like **Valerius Sterling** believe in the "Geometric Method"—that safety comes from following the manual. They view "Variance" (Wild Magic) as dangerous because it is unstable, not because they hate freedom \[`933`, `1031`\].  
* **The "Maintenance" (Rust Tier):** This is not a death sentence or exile. It is the **Engine Room**. Characters like **Lomi** and **Sarge** are the backbone. The tragedy of the Rust tier isn't cruelty; it's invisibility. They keep the city alive while the Golds get the glory \[`1089`, `1090`\].

#### **2\. The Remnant Clans (The Shattered Components)**

The Clans are not "savages." They are the specialized, devolved remnants of the ancient high-tech society that broke.

* **The Ash-Bloods (The Power Source):**

  * *Ancient Function:* The Thermal Core (The Engine).  
  * *Current Trauma:* **The Cooling.** They isolated themselves, and their fire turned to embers.  
  * *Relationship:* They *invited* Harmony (The Beacon of Despair) because they were freezing. The conflict isn't conquest; it's a disagreement on fuel. **Ignatius** thinks Harmony’s battery is "fake," while the Elders know it’s the only thing keeping them warm \[`911`, `913`\].  
* **The Mizizi (The Memory Bank):**

  * *Ancient Function:* The Archive (The Hard Drive).  
  * *Current Trauma:* **Data Corruption.** The forest stopped decaying (refreshing), causing a data-clog.  
  * *Relationship:* Harmony wants to harvest the "Medicine" (Data), but the Mizizi fear the "White Scorch" (Deletion). **Rill** wants to save the forest from *tradition*—she realizes the Elders are deleting history to maintain the status quo \[`837`, `917`\].  
* **The Trench-Kin (The Stabilizers):**

  * *Ancient Function:* Tectonic Anchors (Gravity).  
  * *Current Trauma:* **Depressurization.** The weight of the world is lifting, causing the "Bends."  
  * *Relationship:* Uncontacted. **Iggy** isn't a spy; he is a sentient data-packet trying to upload himself to the surface network to see why the pressure monitors failed \[`921`, `1081`\].

---

### **IV. The Mystery: The Shattered Circuit**

The players are uncovering **Archaeology**, not conspiracy.

* **The Theory:** Dean Vane’s "Shattered Empire Theory" posits that the Clans are not separate species, but specialized castes of the original builders \[`845`\].  
* **The Circuit:**  
  * **Mizizi** \= Memory/RAM.  
  * **Ash-Blood** \= Power/CPU.  
  * **Trench-Kin** \= Stability/Chassis.  
  * **Harmony** \= The Operating System (The Loom).  
* **The Solution:** You cannot "Conquer" a CPU. You have to install it. The campaign is about finding the "Drivers" (The Cultural Keys) to make these incompatible systems talk to each other again before the power fails.

---

### **V. NPC Updates (Reframing Intent)**

| NPC | Old Trope | New "Scientific Romance" Motivation |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Dean Isolde Vane** | Sinister Headmaster | **The Desperate Architect.** She loves the Clans like lost family. She is frantic to solve the "Integration Equation" before the lights die. She hides the crisis to protect the students, not to exploit them \[`846`\]. |
| **Valerius Sterling** | Bully / Antagonist | **The Burdened Legacy.** He truly believes that "Variance" causes Entropy. He antagonizes the PCs because their chaotic methods *terrify* him—he thinks they will accidentally blow up the ship \[`1031`\]. |
| **Rill (Mizizi)** | Traitor / Spy | **The Futurist.** She loves her forest, but she knows the Elders’ "Stagnation" doctrine is suicide. She joined Harmony to find a cure for the "Eternal Growth" cancer, even if it means defying her family \[`837`\]. |
| **Sarge (Squad 09\)** | Broken Veteran | **The Safety Inspector.** He isn't bitter; he's protective. He warns Ignatius about his fire because he's seen unchecked energy kill good people. He wants the squad to survive the physics, not the politics \[`1000`\]. |
| **Old Man Silas** | Shady Smuggler | **The Archivist of Rust.** He collects "Pre-Stitch" tech not for black market greed, but because he knows the old combustion engines are the only things that work when the magic fails \[`864`\]. |

### **VI. Session 1 Adjustments**

Based on this codex, here is how we adjust the tone for the upcoming session:

1. **The Intake isn't a "Cull":** When students are sorted into "Rust," it’s not a rejection. It’s an assignment to **Vital Systems**. The guard says: *"Candidate, your aptitude is structural. Report to Engineering. The Venture cannot fly without a strong hull."* \[`1010`\].  
2. **The Vane/Sterling Conflict:** When Valerius mocks the PCs, it isn't about them being "poor." It's about them being **Uncalibrated**. *"You vibrate at a dangerous frequency. If you don't harmonize, you'll shatter the resonance crystal."*  
3. **The "Glitch":** When the lights flicker (The Minimum), it shouldn't feel like a villain pulled a switch. It should feel like a **heartbeat skipping**. The whole city holds its breath in terror, then sighs in relief when the hum returns. It is a shared trauma.
