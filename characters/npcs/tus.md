# Tus

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Origin** | [[Nstyl|Nstyl (Silent Silt)]] |
| **Rank** | Civillian / Disqualified Candidate |
| **Affiliation** | None (Manipulated by Azor) |
| **First Appearance** | [[session-03\|Session 3]] |

## GM Description
A huge, burly young man from Nstyl, moving with eerie, completely silent coordination. He communicates exclusively via sign language, as spoken word is physically impossible for him. 

## Personality
Earnest, naive, and prone to manipulation due to his heartbreak over failing the Academy entrance exam. He fights with brute force but is not inherently malicious.

## Background
Traveled from Nstyl to join the [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]] but failed the first round of exams. He and Zyykl were duped by an independent Settikan named Azor, who showed them the "revealing" water of Prism Falls to manipulate them into believing they were true Exploranauts just missing the right "paperwork."

## Session Appearances
### Session 3
- Communicated with Zyykl and Azor in sign language outside the Celestial Lounge.
- Ambushed Britt alongside Zyykl in the dark alleyway.
- After securing the test receipt, he fled the scene with Zyykl to avoid further confrontation.

## Relationships
| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| **[[Zyykl]]** | Brother/Fellow Nstyl resident. Fights seamlessly alongside him using sign language. |
| **[[Azor]]** | The Settikan who manipulated him into becoming a mugger. |
| **[[Britt]]** | Victim of the ambush. |

## GM Narration [NOT YET REVEALED TO PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information has been narrated by the GM but is not known to the player characters.

Tus doesn't realize the test receipt is useless to him. His actions stem entirely from Azor's trick using Prism Falls water.
