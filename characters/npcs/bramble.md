# Bramble

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Squad 05 (The Harvesters) - Member |
| **Race** | Plant-kin |
| **Affiliation** | [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]], [[mizizi|Mizizi]] (Plant-Kin?) |
| **Status** | Active |
| **First Appearance** | [[session-02\|Session 2]] |

## Overview
Bramble is a thoughtful, philosophical plant-person. Nobody is entirely sure what Bramble is---plant-person? Harmony botanist who got weird? [[mizizi|Mizizi]]-adjacent? Member of Squad 05, The Harvesters.

## Session 2 Appearance
At the Block 99 bonfire, Bramble participated in the Speculators' Debate. While [[Percival Vane-Smythe III|Percy]] argued for missing clans and [[Iron-Jaw Jax|Jax]] dismissed the idea, Bramble offered the most provocative perspective:

*"What if they are not the missing? What if we are the ones who forgot?"*

## Personality
- Thoughtful and slow-speaking---not mystical, just deliberate
- Offers philosophical perspectives that reframe the debate
- The "what if we forgot" line suggests awareness of deep history
