## Overview

## Relationships
- **[[valentine-sterling-sr|Valentine Sterling Sr.]]**: His father, the legendary explorer. Val inherited his father's charisma and love for the spotlight.
- **[[valerius-sterling|Valerius Sterling]]**: His older cousin and the "Voice of Vumbua" Radio Host. Valerius has been at the academy for years.
- **[[ignatius|Ignatius]]**: Met in the courtyard after Intake. Val was amused by the soot/fire but hesitant to touch him.
- **[[Serra Vox|Seraphina Vox]]:** His teammate and fellow noble. He respects her talent but worries about her eccentricities.
- **The Party:** Rivals. He specifically targets them during assessments.

## Session Appearances

### Session 1
- **The Courtyard Encounter:** Met [[ignatius|Ignatius]] immediately after the intake exam.
- **The Interaction:** Recognized Ignatius as an [[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]].
- **The Handshake:** Hesitated to shake hands ("Will your hand burn me?"), then wiped his hand of soot and stormed off, spitting.
- **Vibe:** "Bridgerton-esque," but with a chaotic social energy.

## Personality
- **Charismatic:** Naturally open
- **Social Butterfly:** Knows everyone, hears everything.
- **Clean:** Obsessed with appearance (hence the soot reaction), but willing to get "dirty" for a good story (metaphorically).

## GM Narration [NOT YET REVEALED TO PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information has been narrated by the GM but is not known to the player characters.

### Backstory
Groomed to lead the Venture since birth. He has never actually touched dirt; his hands are magically calloused to look "rugged." The Sterling family reputation is a heavy, gilded shield he carries everywhere.

### Flaw
Narcissism. He cannot process the idea of someone being more "efficient" than him.

### Valentine Sterling Sr.
During the Silent Era, [[valentine-sterling-sr|Sterling Sr.]] led suicide missions into the blind mist alongside Captain Elara Thorne. But while Thorne was motivated by the existential threat she saw in the Council data, Sterling Sr. cared only about the massive bounties offered for exploration. His son carries the same opportunism.
