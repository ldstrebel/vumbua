## Overview
Valentine is the Scion of House Sterling, son of the legendary explorer [[valentine-sterling-sr|Valentine Sterling Sr.]]. Unlike his rigid cousin [[Valerius Sterling]], Val is approachable, charming, and deeply embedded in the social fabric of the Academy.

## Relationships
- **[[valentine-sterling-sr|Valentine Sterling Sr.]]**: His father, the legendary explorer. Val inherited his father's charisma and love for the spotlight.
- **[[Valerius Sterling]]**: His older cousin and the "Voice of Vumbua" Radio Host. Valerius has been at the academy for years.
- **[[Ignatius]]**: Met in the courtyard after Intake. Val was amused by the soot/fire but hesitant to touch him.
- **[[Serra Vox|Seraphina Vox]]:** His teammate and fellow noble. He respects her talent but worries about her eccentricities.
- **The Party:** Rivals. He specifically targets them during assessments.

## Session Appearances

### Session 1
- **The Courtyard Encounter:** Met [[Ignatius]] immediately after the intake exam.
- **The Interaction:** Recognized Ignatius as an [[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]].
- **The Handshake:** Hesitated to shake hands ("Will your hand burn me?"), then wiped his hand of soot and stormed off, spitting.
- **Vibe:** "Bridgerton-esque," but with a chaotic social energy.

### Session 3 *(Planned)*
- **The Celestial Lounge:** Hosting the late-night gathering, one of the last people still awake.
- Bought one of [[Lucky]]'s test answer packets and found errors — potential RP hook.
- Runs two parlour games: **Crown & Ruin** (push-your-luck dice) and **Truths & Treachery** (truth-or-lie social game).
- [[Ember]] is on his cousin's payroll but socially orbits Val during the party.

## Personality
- **Charismatic:** Naturally open — the kind of person who makes you feel like the most important person in the room.
- **Social Butterfly:** Knows everyone, hears everything. His network *is* his weapon.
- **Clean:** Obsessed with appearance (hence the soot reaction), but willing to get "dirty" for a good story (metaphorically).
- **Performative:** Narrates his own life like a radio commentator. Light-hearted trash talk is his love language.
- **Strategically Vulnerable:** Mixes genuine emotional truths with outrageous claims, making it impossible to tell when he's being real. He *wants* people to underestimate his sincerity.
- **People over places:** He likes *people* more than exploration. He's a social creature on an explorer's path and privately worries he won't be a great Exploranaut.

## GM Narration [NOT YET REVEALED TO PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information has been narrated by the GM but is not known to the player characters.

### Backstory
Groomed to lead the Venture since birth. He has never actually touched dirt; his hands are magically calloused to look "rugged." The Sterling family reputation is a heavy, gilded shield he carries everywhere.

### Flaw
Narcissism. He cannot process the idea of someone being more "efficient" than him.

### Valentine Sterling Sr.
During the Silent Era, [[valentine-sterling-sr|Sterling Sr.]] led suicide missions into the blind mist alongside Captain Elara Thorne. But while Thorne was motivated by the existential threat she saw in the Council data, Sterling Sr. cared only about the massive bounties offered for exploration. His son carries the same opportunism.

### The Sterling Secret
Val knows that [[House Gilded]]'s Crystal Banks are running out of reserves. If the Global Amplitude doesn't surge soon, the lights go out — and so does his family's fortune. He treats this knowledge casually in social settings, but it terrifies him.

### Valerius Rivalry
Val spreads the lie that his cousin [[Valerius Sterling]] failed out of the Academy and started his radio show as a consolation prize. In reality, Valerius graduated — barely, but he did. The rivalry is real, and Valerius's ego makes him a fat target.

### Play Style (for games and social encounters)
- **High Presence.** He's genuinely good at lying — smooth voice, steady eye contact, confident rhythm.
- Strategically mixes real emotional truths with outrageous lies, making it hard to tell which is which.
- If caught in a lie, takes it with grace: *"Well played. I almost had you."*
- If his truth is doubted, a genuine flash of hurt he quickly masks.

### Truths & Treachery Statements *(Session 3)*

| 2 | *"Honestly? I'm here to make my papa proud more than anything else. I like people more than places. I'm not sure I'll make a great explorer."* | **TRUTH** | 🟡 Mid |
| 3 | *"My cousin Valerius started his radio show after he failed out of the Academy. Couldn't hack it as an Exploranaut, so he picked up a microphone instead."* | **LIE** | 🟡 Mid |
| 4 | *"My father once stole a [[Mizizi]] sapling in the middle of the night. Planted it in our courtyard. It died within a week."* | **LIE** | 🟠 Fun |

| 6 | *"My hands have never touched actual dirt. Not once. They're magically treated to look weathered."* | **TRUTH** | 🟡 Mid |
