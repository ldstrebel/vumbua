# Ember

> *"This is such a fun game!"* (said with the energy of someone filing a police report)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | [[Ash-Bloods\|Ash-Blood]] Student / Field Reporter for [[valerius-sterling\|Valerius Sterling]] |
| **Affiliation** | [[Ash-Bloods]], [[Vumbua Academy]] |
| **Status** | Active |
| **First Mentioned** | [[session-02\|Session 2]] |

### Daggerheart Stats *(Tier 1)*

| Stat | Mod | | Stat | Mod |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Agility** | +2 | | **Instinct** | +3 |
| **Strength** | +1 | | **Presence** | −1 |
| **Finesse** | +0 | | **Knowledge** | +1 |

| | |
|---|---|
| **HP** | 5 |
| **Stress** | 4 |
| **Evasion** | 12 |
| **Thresholds** | Minor 3 / Major 7 |
| **Armour** | 0 |

> **Design notes:** Ember is sharp-eyed and physically quick (+3 Instinct, +2 Agility) — she reads people and reacts fast. But her social skills betray her (−1 Presence) — she's too intense, too earnest, and bad at performing. Her lower Stress threshold reflects how easily her composure cracks under social pressure.

## Overview
Ember is an Ash-Blood student and [[Ignatius]]'s childhood cousin. She represents the **modernizer** faction among the [[Ash-Bloods]]---those who embrace Harmony's technology and prefer "clean" crystal battery energy over traditional organic fire.

She works as a field reporter for [[valerius-sterling|Valerius Sterling]]'s radio show, attending social events and gathering stories. She's angling for her own segment: *"Ember's Embers"* — three minutes, once a week. The name is embarrassing and she knows it.

## The Cultural Divide
Ember is excited to use Harmony's batteries and refuses to touch organic fire ever again. This puts her in direct opposition to traditionalists like [[Ignatius]], who views her stance as disrespectful to Ash-Blood heritage.

Before coming to Vumbua, she had already started dressing like a Harmony citizen. She was ashamed of fitting in with Harmony more than she ever fit in at home — and that shame is its own secret.

[[Serra Vox]] mentioned Ember during the Session 2 bonfire conversation about Ash-Blood cultural tensions.

## Personality
- **Intense and Observant:** Studies people like surveillance footage. Head tilted, eyes narrowed, barely blinks. She reads people better than she reads books.
- **Trying Too Hard:** She wants desperately to be seen as "one of them" — not "the Ash-Blood girl." She laughs a beat too late at jokes. She uses Harmony slang slightly wrong. The effort is visible.
- **Competitive to a Fault:** Everything is a test. Games, conversations, even casual banter — she treats it all like something she can win. She doesn't understand the concept of "just for fun."
- **Earnest When Caught Off Guard:** When the performance drops — when she's asked something personal — her voice goes quiet and real. These moments are rare and powerful.
- **Modernizer at Heart:** The clean fire of Harmony — crystal energy — feels more alive to her than the volcano's heat ever did. The first time she held a battery, she felt *home.*
- **Ambitious:** She doesn't just want to report for Valerius. She wants her own voice, her own platform, her own story.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| **[[Ignatius]]** | Childhood cousin. He considers her rejection of fire disrespectful to their heritage. She remembers him catching salamanders and naming them after radio hosts. |
| **[[Lady Ignis]]** | Likely aligned with Ignis's pragmatic pro-integration stance. |
| **[[valerius-sterling\|Valerius Sterling]]** | Her employer and, secretly, her role model. She admires his command of language and his confidence. She tells people she works for him "because he feeds her well" — the truth is she works for him because he makes her feel like she belongs. |
| **[[valentine-sterling\|Valentine Sterling]]** | Social companion at Academy events. She looks at him differently when he shows vulnerability. |

## GM Notes [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### Core Tension
Ember's deepest truth is that Harmony's clean energy feels more alive to her than the Ash-Blood volcano ever did. When she says this, she means it — and if [[Ignatius]] hears it, it's a bomb.

### The Valerius Arrangement
She tells people she works for Valerius because he feeds her well. The real reason is belonging — Valerius represents everything she wants to be: Harmony-passing, confident, commanding. The food is fine. The real payment is identity.

### Play Style (for games and social encounters)
- **Low Presence, high Instinct.** She's bad at lying (too intense, too earnest) but *excellent* at reading others.
- When lying, her delivery is too intense — easy to catch.
- When reading others, she stares right through them.
- If she guesses wrong, she takes the consequence fast and immediately explains her reasoning to nobody.
