| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | [[Ash-Bloods\|Ash-Blood]] Student |
| **Affiliation** | [[ash-bloods|Ash-Bloods]], [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]] |
| **Status** | Active (mentioned but not yet appeared on-screen) |

## Overview
Ember is an Ash-Blood student and [[ignatius|Ignatius]]'s childhood cousin. She represents the **modernizer** faction among the [[ash-bloods|Ash-Bloods]]---those who embrace Harmony's technology and prefer "clean" crystal battery energy over traditional organic fire.

## The Cultural Divide
Ember is excited to use Harmony's batteries and refuses to touch organic fire ever again. This puts her in direct opposition to traditionalists like [[ignatius|Ignatius]], who views her stance as disrespectful to Ash-Blood heritage.

[[serra-vox|Serra Vox]] mentioned Ember during the Session 2 bonfire conversation about Ash-Blood cultural tensions.

## Personality
- Enthusiastic about Harmony's "clean" energy
- Rejects traditional fire-tending as outdated
- Represents the younger Ash-Blood generation that sees integration as liberation, not compromise
