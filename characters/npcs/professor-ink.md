# Professor Ink

| | |
|---|---|
| **Aliases** | Ink, Professor Ink |
| **Role** | Scrivener Guild Captain / Fungal Biology Specialist |
| **Affiliation** | [[scrivener-guild|Scrivener Guild]] |
| **Archetype** | The Academic |
| **Status** | Active |

## Overview

Professor Ink is a veteran explorer and researcher from the [[scrivener-guild|Scrivener Guild]]. Unlike many Captains who seek fame or fortune, Ink is driven by a **pure thirst for knowledge**. He views the world as a vast library waiting to be indexed and understood. He is currently a faculty member at [[Vumbua Academy]], specialising in fungal biology and the resonance properties of organic matter.

## Personality

- **Academic and Rigorous:** He has little patience for sloppy research or "guesswork." If it isn't documented and peer-reviewed, it isn't real.
- **Intellectual Curiosity:** He is fascinated by anything new. He genuinely loves [[Iggy]]'s relentless curiosity and will spend hours debating resonance theory with him.
- **Nervous Energy:** He is protective of his work and specimens. He frequently worries that [[Ignatius]] (who he calls "the fire-boy") will accidentally incinerate his delicate fungal cultures.
- **Scientific Peer:** He treats [[Rill]] as an intellectual equal, valueing her cultural insights into the [[Mizizi]] Forest as essential scientific data.

## Current Activities

- **Researching "Weeping Nodes":** Working alongside [[Rill]] to understand why certain resonance points in the [[Mizizi Petrified Forest]] are bleeding energy.
- **The Forest Expedition:** Planning a dangerous mission into the heart of the Mizizi Forest to study the "memories" of the petrified trees. He believes these trees are literal living records of Harmony's history.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| **[[Rill]]** | Research partners and close colleagues. They balance each other's perspectives (Academic vs Cultural). |
| **[[Iggy]]** | Mentor figure; deeply impressed by Iggy's inquisitive mind. |
| **[[Ignatius]]** | Terrified of him. Keeps a fire extinguisher within reach at all times. |
| **[[Dean Isolde Vane]]** | Respects her leadership but finds her pacing and social energy exhausting. |
