# Lady Ignis

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | [[Ash-Bloods\|Ash-Blood]] Matriarch / Harmony's Highest Voting Power |
| **Affiliation** | [[ash-bloods|Ash-Bloods]], Harmony Council |
| **Location** | [[harmony-prime|Harmony Prime]] (High Council) |
| **Status** | Active |
| **First Mentioned** | [[session-02\|Session 2]] |

## Overview
The leader of the Ash-Blood clan who integrated with Harmony. Under the **Inverse Power Doctrine**, she currently holds the **highest voting power** in all of Harmony---essentially the "President"---because the [[ash-bloods|Ash-Bloods]] are the newest formally integrated member.

## The Inverse Power Doctrine
Harmony grants the newest integrated member the highest voting power to prevent exploitation. *"The least of us should become the most of us."* This ensures that the people who live in newly integrated lands make decisions about their own resources. It's kept the peace for a thousand years.

Lady Ignis holds this position because the [[ash-bloods|Ash-Bloods]] were the most recent full integration (~24 months ago).

## Personality
- **Pragmatic, Regnal:** Takes the long view. She knows the [[ash-bloods|Ash-Bloods]] were "cooling" and dying out; Harmony offered survival.
- **Conflict:** Viewed with suspicion by traditionalists (like [[ignatius|Ignatius]]?) but commands immense respect.
- The [[ash-bloods|Ash-Bloods]] were going through a "Great Cooling" (volcanoes dying) before Harmony found them. Integration revived the heat.
