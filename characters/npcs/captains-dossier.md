# ***.⚓ The Captains' Manifest: The Proving Voyage***

***Phase:** The 1-Month "Proving Voyage" (Internship).*

***Objective:** Field testing in the "Safe Zone" and Periphery before the deep expedition.*

***The "Captain's Boon":** Each Captain has a discretionary pool of **50 Loom Points** to award to a single candidate (or split amongst a squad) who demonstrates exceptional promise. This Boon acts as a "Direct Commission."*

## ***📋 The Selection Board***

*Candidates must secure a berth by 0800 hours. Minimum squad deployment size: 7 Candidates.*

| *Captain Name (Faction)* | *Tagline (Vibe)* | *Their Bet (Direction/Goal)* | *Ideal Candidate (Job Posting)* | *Craft (Description)* | *DM Notes (1-Month Outcome)* |

Combat skills required for 'Pest Control'."* | *A sleek, gold-plated diplomatic cruiser designed for speed and press conferences.* | ***The Guardian.** The monument is real. It holds a cipher for the next map segment, but it is guarded by a massive Aether-Beast he ran from last time. He needs the squad to kill it so he can claim the glory.* |
| ***2\. Cpt. Kaelo "Ghost" Vane** (Vane Lineage)* | *"We were never here."* | ***Up-River Fog.** Betting on mapping hydrological anomalies in the dense fog belt to the East.* | *"Looking for 'Silence' proficiency.

Ignis "Scorch"** (Iron-Union)* | *"Speed is survival."* | ***Vertical Climb.** Betting on finding stable atmospheric currents at the summit of a vertical "Storm-Needle" mountain.* | *"Must have Heat-Resistance or high Constitution.

Must be willing to break Clan Taboos for the sake of knowledge."* | ***The Curio:** A floating library/laboratory cluttered with specimens and smelling of formaldehyde.* | ***The Living Library.** They reach a "Grandfather Tree."

"Old Man" Silas** (Independent)* | *"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."* | ***Trash Vortex.** Betting on salvaging valuable components from the Academy's own waste stream.* | *"I need strong backs. If you can lift a crate, you're hired. No complainers."* | *A rusted garbage scow that smells of grease and old fish.* | ***The Pre-Stitch Engine.** They find a rusted combustion engine in the trash.

Must pass a 'Pressure-Test'."* | *A claustrophobic iron sphere reinforced with too many rivets.* | ***The Miracle (Maybe).** 99% chance of just thermal vents. 1% chance (Nat 20/Iggy) to see a "Light" in the deep.

Must understand 'Leverage' and 'Contracts'."* | *A luxury land-yacht walker with armed guards and velvet seats.* | ***Aether-Grazers.** They find a herd of peaceful giant beasts.

Must be willing to carry luggage and skin trophies."* | *An open-decked reconnaissance flyer with trophy mounts.* | *\*\* The Apex Predator.\*\* The beast hunts them. Survival horror session. High glory if they kill it.* |

Must be comfortable with heights."* | *A high-altitude balloon platform.* | ***The Distant Storm.** They spot a massive, unnatural storm far away (Cloud-Kin hint).* |

| ***25\. The Archivist** (Scrivener Guild)* | *"Preserve the silence."* | ***Quiet Zone.** Betting on recording pure ambient soundscapes in isolated valleys.* | *"Must have Stealth. Loud breathing is grounds for dismissal."* | *A silent, non-motorized sailplane.* | ***Ghost Signal.** They record a faint, rhythmic tapping that sounds like code (Pre-Stitch).* |

## ***🕵️ Key Captain Dossiers & Secret Agendas***

### ***1\. Valentine Sterling (The Glory Hound)***

* ***The Pitch:** "Join the elite. We have the best food, the best press, and the least chance of death."*  
* ***The Secret:** He isn't actually exploring. He's re-visiting a "Safe Node" discovered 20 years ago and pretending it's new for the cameras.*  
* ***The Risk:** Zero danger, but zero respect from real explorers.*

### ***2\. Kaelo "Ghost" Vane (The Spy)***

* ***The Pitch:** "The Academy needs eyes, not heroes. Help me see what the River Clan is hiding."*  
* ***The Secret:** Kaelo suspects the River Clan has a weapon that can ground the Sky-Spire.*  
* ***The Risk:** If caught, the Academy will disavow you. You will be left behind.*

### ***3\. Ignis "Scorch" (The Daredevil)***

* ***The Pitch:** "We are going to run the engine at 120% until it melts or we win."*  
* ***The Secret:** His engine is melting. He needs an Elemental (Ignatius) or a Mechanic (Loami) to physically hold it together during the climb.*  
* ***The Risk:** High probability of explosion. High probability of glory.*

### ***4\. Elara Thorne (The Saint)***

* ***The Pitch:** "We are bringing food and medicine to the 'Rust' populations stranded outside the gates."*  
* ***The Secret:** She is smuggling unregistered "Rust" candidates back into the city disguised as patients.*  
* ***The Risk:** You become an accomplice to treason against the Loom's sorting protocols.*

### ***5\. Professor Althea Ink (The Xenobotanist)***

* ***The Pitch:** "The Mizizi fear the 'Old Growth' because they say it whispers. I say it reads. Help me prove the forest is a library before the Verdant Trust mulches it."*  
* ***The Secret:** She is secretly working with **Rill** (the River-Born adoptee). Rill provides the coordinates; Ink provides the ship. They are trying to extract a "Core Sample" from an Ancient Tree to prove it contains data, not just wood.*  
* ***The Risk:** The "Whispers" in the Old Growth are psychic data-dumps. Low-Willpower characters might get overwritten by ancient history.*

### ***6\. "Old Man" Silas (The Scrapper)***

* ***The Pitch:** "I ain't got a speech. Get on the boat or don't."*  
* ***The Secret:** Silas has found a "Pre-Stitch" vault in the trash vortex. He needs a crew stupid enough to help him haul it out.*  
* ***The Risk:** Tetanus. Also, the vault might be booby-trapped.*

### ***7\. Captain "Iron-Lung" Jorah (The Submariner)***

* ***The Pitch:** "The surface is a lie. The heat is down deep. Join me in the dark."*  
* ***The Secret:** He is searching for the "Deep-Mother," a mythical creature the Trench-Kin worship.*  
* ***The Risk:** Structural implosion. Total darkness.*

### ***8\. Captain "Iron-Hide" (The Shield)***

* ***The Pitch:** "We don't run. We tank. I bring everyone home, even if I have to carry the ship myself."*  
* ***The Secret:** He isn't looking for a Node; he's field-testing a new "Ablative Hull" made of compressed Ash-blood obsidian.*  
* ***The Loami Hook:** Iron-Hide is a living legend among the Iron-Union. He started as a Copper-rank boiler scrubber (just like Loami). He famously saved the last expedition by manually holding a cracked thermal vent shut with his own geomantic skin for 6 hours. He also wrote "The Percussive Maintenance Guide (Vol. 4)," which is likely the only textbook Loami actually likes.*  
* ***The Risk:** You will take damage. A lot of it. But you won't die.*  
* ***Iggy Hook:** THIS is the boat that first disrupted the tides above the deepkin shelf. It returned regularly and it is how he hitch-hiked to shore (which was massively impressive to do considering the weaponry and defenses)*

## ***🎲 The 50-Point Boon (Mechanic)***

*When the players choose a Captain, they must "Interview" (Roleplay \+ Roll).*

* ***Great Success (DC 18+):** The Captain grants the **Full Boon (+50 Points)** to the character.*  
  * *Effect: This guarantees Gold Rank for anyone (even Loami).*  
* ***Success (DC 12-17):** The Captain grants a **Partial Boon (+20 Points)**.*  
  * *Effect: Enough to bump a Silver to Gold or a Copper to Silver.*  
* ***Failure (DC \< 12):** The Captain accepts them as "Grunt Labor" (0 Points).*  
  * *Effect: They are just along for the ride. No rank increase.*

***Squad Dilemma:***

*Since **Squad 7-Alpha** must deploy together, they must convince a Captain to take all of them.*

* ***Valentine** won't take Loami (Copper).*  
* ***Ghost** thinks Britt is too loud.*  
* ***Ink** loves Iggy but fears Ignatius will burn his specimens.*  
* ***Silas** will take anyone, but offers no prestige.*

*This forces the players to leverage their connections to get the whole squad hired by a "Good" captain, or settle for the "Bad" one.*
