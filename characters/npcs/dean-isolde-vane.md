## GM Description

A small, energetic figure---comparable to a female Professor Heimerdinger from *Arcane*. She bounces onto stage rather than walking, paces frantically during speeches, and radiates chaotic enthusiasm. Her size is notable; she is dwarfed by the podium and the massive auditorium she addresses. Despite leading the largest mobile city in Harmony, she presents as scattered and approachable rather than authoritative.

## Personality

- **Enthusiastic to the point of chaos:** Paces frantically, speaks in rapid bursts, forgets to introduce herself
- **Genuinely excited about discovery:** Her love of exploration comes across as authentic, not performative
- **Scattered but sharp:** Forgot to say her own name during the welcome speech, popped back out from the curtain to add it as an afterthought
- **Lonely in her role:** Admitted openly that 80 years of stagnation left her lonely---"Not to say my thousand weren't great, but more is better!"
- **Blunt about stakes:** Casually dropped that 20,000 students would be cut by week's end, without sugarcoating it

## Background

Dean of [[Vumbua Academy]] and member of the [[vane-lineage|Vane Lineage]] ([[Vane Lineage|House Vane]]), which historically controls defense and walls. She has led the Academy through the 80-year Silent Era of no new discoveries and championed the relocation to the [[ash-blood-isles|Ash-Blood Isles]] 6 months ago.

## Session Appearances

### Session 1

- Bounced onto stage in the Great Hall to welcome the 100,000-strong intake class
- Gave an enthusiastic, scattered speech about the end of the 80-year silence and the excitement of new discoveries
- Praised the [[ash-bloods|Ash-Bloods]] for "mastery of heat" and the [[mizizi|Mizizi]], admitting "we don't really know what they do, and that's amazing!"
- Casually announced 20,000 more students would be cut by end of the week
- Forgot to introduce herself, then popped back out from behind the curtain: "Oh! I'm Dean. I'm Dean Isolde! If you need me... well, I'm kind of busy."
- [[rill|Rill]] (the Dean's assistant) leaned out, pulled her back behind the curtain with a familiar, comfortable dynamic
- [[britt|Britt]]'s immediate reaction: "I don't trust this f***ing guy." (mistaking her gender or just expressing suspicion)

### Session 2

- Not present on screen. [[serra-vox|Serra Vox]] identified [[rill|Rill]] as the person who pulled the Dean off stage.

## GM Narration [NOT YET REVEALED TO PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-  
> The following information has been narrated by the GM but is not known to the player characters.

### The Desperate Truth

Dean Isolde knows the power is failing. The scattered, bubbly persona masks a leader carrying an existential secret: if this intake class doesn't find a strong Node, the lights at the Academy---and back home---will go out forever. Vumbua cannot travel back if they fail; there isn't enough power to move the Cores. But the new clans are her salvation, and she is so excited to welcome them into thr fold

### The Shattered Circuit

Dean Vane has not yet been informed by Kante of the theories he has

### The "Great Cull" Strategy

The massive intake class (largest in history) just happened to fall on her long term, she has been the Dean for generations at this point. The philosophy: expect 95% attrition during the Trials and another 20% loss during Intern Voyages. Stop training "Glory Seekers" and start manufacturing "Survivalists."

### Political Tension

Lord Commander Titus Vane ([[vane-lineage|Vane Lineage]]) wants aggressive expansion tactics - meaining risky not violent. Dean Isolde favors empathy and integration through cultural connection. This tension within her own family lineage is an ongoing pressure.

### The Loom

The Loom calculates "Savant" flags based on variance---high-variance outliers who solve problems using unsanctioned methods. Dean Isolde understands and uses this system, but its full implications are a closely guarded secret.

### Lore Dump vs. Session Canon

The original planning document depicted Dean Isolde differently---in a "crisp, high-collared white uniform" delivering a polished, controlled speech gripping the podium so hard the brass creaked. In actual session play, she was instead portrayed as small, bouncy, scattered, and genuinely enthusiastic. Session canon takes precedence.  She is described as a Professor Heimerdinger (Arcane) inspired persona
