# Resonance Racers

This page details the notable teams and soloists competing in the intake year's opening [[circuit-run|Resonance Race]].

## Team 1: Shatter Stamper
| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Heavy-Class Racing Team |
| **Rig** | **The Ironclad** - A massive, brutalist heavy rig built for straight-line speed and surviving impacts. It lacks maneuverability but makes up for it in sheer momentum and thick armor plating. |
| **Strategy** | **Brute Force & Overclocking.** They aim for high-yield nodes to offset their incredible weight, relying on raw power to bulldoze through obstacles rather than steering around them. |

## Team 3: Marble Wall
| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Aggro/Hunter Team |
| **Rig** | **The Bastion** - A reinforced heavy crawler covered in reactive armor. Less a racing vehicle and more a mobile blockade designed to absorb and dish out punishment. |
| **Strategy** | **Attrition & Elimination.** They don't race to win by speed; they hunt the competition. Their strategy is to destroy or disable faster, smaller rigs early on, securing a win by being the last team left functional or heavily crippling the frontrunners. |

## Team 4: Pudge
| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Experimental Light-Class Team |
| **Rig** | **The Gryphon-Hybrid** - A heavily customized, bulbous gyro-boat. It looks aerodynamically questionable ("pudgy") but incorporates experimental Aero-Static components that allow it to catch thermals and glide over uneven terrain. |
| **Strategy** | **High-Risk Synchronization.** Their rig requires massive connection to overcome its design handicap. They rely on linking with specialized nodes (like Vitruvian and Aero-Static) to double their sync duration and perform massive vertical jumps, bypassing complex terrain. |

## Team 5: Dancer & Fabian
| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Underdog / Precision Team |
| **Rig** | **The Glass-Sail** - A beautifully crafted, lightweight racing sailboat. It has the lowest power rating in the field but features incredibly precise steering mechanisms and a hull capable of minor resonant-phasing. |
| **Strategy** | **Agility & Evasion.** They rely on technical skill, precision drafting, and striking specific nodes (like Crystalline or Kinetic-Echo) to outmaneuver heavier, aggressive teams. They turn cornering and dodging into an art form. |

## Notable Soloists

### Stinger
- **Rig:** A minimalist, razor-thin hover-bike consisting of little more than a seat, a battery, and a Harvest-Prong. 
- **Strategy:** Extreme speed and tight weaving. Highly vulnerable to physical damage and heat stress; relies entirely on not getting hit.

### Goliath
- **Rig:** A massive land-ship, officially listed as a soloist but the size of a mobile fortress.
- **Strategy:** Survive "The Drop" and act as a moving hazard. Very slow, but virtually indestructible by standard rigs.
