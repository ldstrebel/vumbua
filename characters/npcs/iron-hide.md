# Captain "Iron-Hide"

> "The ship breaks before the crew does. We don't run. We tank."
> — *Captain Iron-Hide*

| **Role** | Venture Captain |
| **Faction** | [[Iron-Union]] |
| **Craft** | **The Bulwark** (The "Unsinkable" Fortress) – 110% Over-Plated over-under sea behemoth |
| **Risk/Reward** | You will take damage. A lot of it. But you won't die. |

## Overview
Captain "Iron-Hide" is a living legend among the Iron-Union. He is famously known for having started as a Copper-rank boiler scrubber (just like [[Lomi]]) and rising to the rank of Captain through sheer grit and endurance. He once saved a previous expedition by manually holding a cracked thermal vent shut with his own geomantic skin for 6 hours.

He is the author of *"The Percussive Maintenance Guide (Vol. 4)"*, a textbook highly regarded by mechanics.

## The Bet (Direction/Goal)
**The Patrol:** He is betting on aether beasts threatening the coastline and is determined to fight them off. He believes in bringing everyone home, even if he has to carry the ship himself.

## Secret Agenda & Hook
* **The Secret:** He isn't actually looking for a Node; he's field-testing a new "Ablative Hull" made of compressed Ash-blood obsidian.
* **[[Lomi]] Hook:** As a fellow copper-rank boiler scrubber turned legend, he is Lomi's hero (though in person, he is just a very tired, very sturdy mechanic).
* **[[Iggy]] Hook:** The Bulwark is the exact ship that first disrupted the tides above the deepkin shelf. It returned regularly, and Iggy used it to hitchhike to the shore—a massively impressive feat considering its weaponry and defenses.
