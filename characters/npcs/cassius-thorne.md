# Cassius Thorne

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Student (Gold Rank) |
| **Affiliation** | Harmony (Thorne Family), [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]] |
| **Squad** | Squad 01 — The Echelon |
| **Status** | Active |
| **First Appearance** | [[session-02\|Session 2]] |

## Overview
Cassius Thorne is the son of **Captain Elara Thorne**, the exploranaut who discovered the Ash-Blood Isles. He's a nervous, bookish student who hides behind textbook knowledge and perfectionism. Despite his Gold rank and famous family name, he'd rather study thermal distribution than live up to the Thorne legacy.

## Session 2 Appearance
At the Block 99 bonfire, Cassius was obsessively arranging logs for "optimal thermal distribution" when [[ignatius|Ignatius]] lit the fire prematurely. He panicked (*"The thermal distribution was---this is very non-optimal!"*) but was charmed by [[lomi|Lomi]]'s critical-success encouragement.

He has a visible crush on [[serra-vox|Serra Vox]]---glancing at her for approval, cheeks turning rosy when she's nearby. He admitted: *"I wasn't planning to come here tonight. But I felt like this was the place to be."*

## Personality
- Nervous, bookish, and detail-oriented
- Follows the textbook rigidly---quotes the manual on everything
- Genuinely kind underneath the anxiety
- Desperate to earn something on his own, not ride the Thorne name
