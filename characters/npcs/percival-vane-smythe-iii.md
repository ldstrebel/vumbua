# Percival "Percy" Vane-Smythe III

> "Mark my words! When we find the missing clans, I'll be vindicated!"

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Squad 08 (The Legacy) - Captain (Gold Rank) |
| **Affiliation** | [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]], [[Vane Lineage\|House Vane]] (Harmony) |
| **Origin** | Shepta (southern desert city) |
| **Status** | Active |
| **First Appearance** | [[session-02\|Session 2]] |

## Overview
Percy is a well-dressed, genuinely curious theorist---not the entitled noble his appearance suggests. He's passionate about the **Sixfold Theory** (the fringe academic belief that six clans must exist to complete an elemental symmetry) and would rather study obscure journals than attend galas. A distant nephew of the Dean.

## Session 2 Appearance
At the Block 99 bonfire, Percy was holding court about the Sixfold Theory, arguing passionately with [[iron-jaw-jax|Iron-Jaw Jax]], [[bramble|Bramble]], and [[zephyr|Zephyr]].

*"I'll wager 50 sovereigns that there's an Earth clan underground! We've got Plants, Fire... there MUST be an Earth clan to complete the symmetry!"*

When [[lomi|Lomi]] mentioned hearing noises in the boiler room, Percy was delighted: *"See! Salt of the earth! The boiler workers know!"* He introduced himself as Percy Vane-Smythe III and immediately bonded with Lomi.

Percy led the group to [[lucky|Lucky]] to buy "Engine Grease" (moonshine), showing he knows the campus hustler network. He paid in sovereigns.

## Personality
- Genuinely curious and reads obscure academic journals
- Views Vumbua as "the greatest library in the world"
- Wants to be an academic, not a military captain (against [[Vane Lineage|House Vane]] tradition)
- Believes Harmony's mission is noble: "preserving knowledge and preventing another Dark Age"
- Well-connected socially (knows [[lucky|Lucky]], navigates both bonfire and fancy party scenes)

## The Sixfold Theory
Percy's core belief: the known clans (Plants/[[mizizi|Mizizi]], Fire/[[ash-bloods|Ash-Bloods]]) are only part of a larger pattern. He theorizes Earth, Air, Water, and possibly more clans exist undiscovered.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship |

| **[[lomi|Lomi]]** | Bonded quickly over shared curiosity. Respects him as "salt of the earth." |
| **[[lucky|Lucky]]** | His supplier for contraband. Existing business relationship. |
| **[[iron-jaw-jax|Iron-Jaw Jax]]** | Ongoing debate partner (Jax thinks the theory is nonsense). |
| **[[bramble|Bramble]]** | Fellow debater at the bonfire. |
| **[[zephyr|Zephyr]]** | Fellow debater at the bonfire. |
| **[[britt|Britt]]/[[aggie|Aggie]]** | Fascinated by them as potential evidence for his theories. |
