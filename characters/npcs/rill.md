# Rill (The River-Born)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Aliases** | Real, Rill, The River-Born |
| **Role** | Dean's Assistant / [[mizizi|Mizizi]] Researcher / "Traitor" / Futurist |
| **Affiliation** | Harmony (Publicly [[mizizi|Mizizi]], Secretly [[wadi|Wadi]]) |
| **Location** | Grass-covered building inset into the hill (near [[block-99|Block 99]]) |
| **Status** | Active |
| **Archetype** | The Futurist |
| **First Appearance** | [[session-01\|Session 1]] |

## Overview
Rill is a researcher at [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]] who is publicly known as a **[[mizizi|Mizizi]]** traitor who left the Forest two years ago. **Secretly, she is a [[wadi|Wadi]] ([[Wadi|River Clan]])** member who has integrated so perfectly that she passes as Mizizi. She arrived at the Academy **2 months ago** after spending time in the "Silent Zones" between leaving the forest and joining Harmony. [[serra-vox|Serra Vox]] describes her as *"one of the greatest inventors in our age."*

## Session 2 Appearance
Rill appeared on stage during the Dean's Welcome ceremony, pulling [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Isolde]] back behind the curtain. She waved good luck to the [[mizizi|Mizizi]] students ([[britt|Britt]] and [[aggie|Aggie]]).

Later at the Block 99 bonfire, Rill appeared after [[zephyr|Zephyr]]'s lightning incident to retrieve her: *"There you are! We've been looking all over for you."* She bribed Zephyr with hot chocolate and dragged her away.

Before leaving, she recognized [[britt|Britt]] and [[aggie|Aggie]] and told them to come find her after class tomorrow, pointing to the grass-covered building inset into the hill.

When [[ignatius|Ignatius]] asked [[zephyr|Zephyr]]'s name, Rill called back: *"Her name is Zephyr, [[Ignatius|Lava Boy]]."*

## Timeline
- **2 Years Ago:** Left the [[mizizi|Mizizi]] Forest (The "Traitor" event).
- **2 Months Ago:** Arrived at [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]] as a researcher.
- **Session 2:** Appeared at Dean's Welcome and bonfire; managing [[zephyr|Zephyr]] on Dean's behalf.

## Personality
- **Intelligent, Determined:** She loves the forest, but knows the Elders' "Stagnation" doctrine is suicide.
- **Goal:** Joined Harmony to find a cure for the "Eternal Growth" cancer/data corruption affecting the [[mizizi|Mizizi]].
- **Connection:** Knows [[britt|Britt]] and [[aggie|Aggie]] from her time in the forest. They may not know her true [[wadi|Wadi]] nature.
- **The Secret:** Her [[wadi|Wadi]] heritage gives her a different perspective on "Flow" and "Stagnation" than a true [[mizizi|Mizizi]], allowing her to solve problems they cannot.
- Has a familiar relationship with [[dean-isolde-vane|Dean Isolde Vane]].
- Manages [[zephyr|Zephyr]] on behalf of the Dean (knows how to handle her---hot chocolate, patience).
