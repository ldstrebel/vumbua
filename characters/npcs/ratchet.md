## GM Narration [NOT YET REVEALED TO PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information has been narrated by the GM but is not known to the player characters.

### Planning Notes
In the lore dump, Ratchet welcomes [[lomi|Lomi]] to Block 99: *"Welcome to the boiler room, kid. Don't believe the Dean. This place isn't a school; it's a battery, and we're the acid."*

### Bond
His specialized toolset---the one thing he actually cares about.

### Flaw
Chronic Cynicism. He has given up on the system but not on surviving it.
