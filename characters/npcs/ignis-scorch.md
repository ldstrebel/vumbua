# Captain Ignis "Scorch"

> "Speed is survival! We are going to run the engine at 120% until it melts or we win."
> — *Captain Scorch*

| **Role** | Venture Captain |
| **Faction** | [[Iron-Union]] |
| **Craft** | A heavy industrial walker with an overclocked boiler and climbing spikes |
| **Risk/Reward** | High probability of explosion. High probability of glory. |

## Overview
Captain Ignis "Scorch" is a daredevil Captain from the Iron-Union offering berths for the Proving Voyage. Known for prioritizing speed over safety, Scorch runs his engine dangerously past its limits.

## The Bet (Direction/Goal)
**Vertical Climb:** He is betting on finding stable atmospheric currents at the summit of a vertical "Storm-Needle" mountain.

## Secret Agenda & Hook
* **The Secret:** His engine is literally melting. He needs an Elemental (like [[Ignatius]]) to handle the heat or an expert Mechanic (like [[Lomi]]) to physically hold it together during the climb.
* **The Pitch:** Looking for candidates with Heat-Resistance or high Constitution, ready to push past mortal limits.
