# Zyykl

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Origin** | [[Nstyl|Nstyl (Silent Silt)]] |
| **Rank** | Civillian / Disqualified Candidate |
| **Affiliation** | None (Manipulated by Azor) |

## GM Description
A very large, powerful young man from Nstyl. He communicates entirely through sign language and physically cannot speak. He is burly and farm-strong from the Nstyl quarries. 

## Personality
Silent but fiercely coordinated in a group. He is earnest, naive, and desperate to prove himself after failing the entrance exam. He doesn't act out of evil intent, but out of a misguided belief that he is reclaiming what was wrongly taken from him.

## Background
Came from Nstyl to enter the [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]] but failed the first round of the entrance exams. Devastated, he and Tus were manipulated by Azor, who used Prism Falls water to convince them they were "true Exploranauts" and that stealing a test receipt could grant them a second chance. 

## Session Appearances
### Session 3
- Communicated with Tus and Azor in sign language outside the Celestial Lounge.
- Participated in the alley ambush against Britt, striking her. 
- Succeeded in stealing Britt's test receipt.
- Fled the scene alongside Tus while Britt prioritized chasing down Azor for her family heirloom.

## GM Narration [NOT YET REVEALED TO PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information has been narrated by the GM but is not known to the player characters.

Zyykl genuinely believes the Prism Falls water over the Academy's test results. Once the truth of the receipt's worthlessness sets in, he will likely be deeply confused and ashamed of his actions.
