# Azor

> *"The water said you were real. The paper will prove it."*

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Origin** | [[Settika]] |
| **Rank** | Unknown |
| **Affiliation** | Independent Schemer |
| **First Appearance** | [[session-03\|Session 3]] |

## GM Description
A world-wise, street-smart manipulator from [[Settika]]. The smaller leader of the trio that ambushed Britt. He knows how things work — Loom receipts, Academy bureaucracy, Prism Falls water — and uses that knowledge to exploit those who don't.

## Personality
Sneaky and manipulative. Rationalizes his actions to an irresponsible degree. Feels no remorse for taking advantage of naive individuals like Tus and Zyykl. Not a fighter; prefers to watch from the shadows and only engaged Britt when chased down and tackled.

## Background
Failed his own candidacy run for the Academy. Afterwards, he decided to con two Nstyl brothers (Tus and Zyykl) by using Prism Falls water to convince them they deserved to be in the Academy, tricking them into ambushing students to steal their test receipts.

## Session Appearances
### Session 3
- Mentally manipulated Zyykl and Tus into ambushing Britt to steal a test receipt.
- Led Britt on a chase into an alleyway ("game of evasion").
- Snatched Britt's family heirloom (a petrified acorn necklace) but was chased down, tackled, and pinned by her. 
- During interrogation, he revealed his con, claimed the test receipts were useless anyway, and showed no remorse.
- Britt ripped his pocket watch from his coat as compensation.
- Disgusted by his attitude, Lomi punched him in the gut, breaking his rib and leaving him helpless against the wall.

## GM Narration [NOT YET REVEALED TO PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information has been narrated by the GM but is not known to the player characters.

Azor knew the test receipts were worthless for his Nstyl pawns because The Loom doesn't recognize transferred IDs. His actual goal was just to mug rich, drunk students during the chaos of the ambush.
