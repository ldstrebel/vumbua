# Iron-Jaw Jax

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Squad 02 (The Breakers) - Captain (Silver/Gold) |
| **Race** | Warforged (Construct) |
| **Affiliation** | [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]] |
| **Status** | Active |
| **First Appearance** | [[session-02\|Session 2]] |

## Overview
Jax is a young warforged---still has "curves" and hasn't quite "slimmed out" yet. Leader of Squad 02, "The Breakers." Known for brute force solutions but also a skeptic who dismisses academic theories.

## Session 2 Appearance
At the Block 99 bonfire, Jax was part of the Speculators' Debate with [[Percival Vane-Smythe III|Percy]], [[bramble|Bramble]], and [[zephyr|Zephyr]]. He dismissed the Sixfold Theory: *"That's nonsense. We found [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Blood]] and Maze. That's probably all there is."*

When [[zephyr|Zephyr]] caused a massive purple lightning bolt, Jax's jaw literally fell off his face. He picked it up and reattached it.

## Personality
- Boisterous, competitive, and loves a good brawl
- Cynical about academic speculation---believes what he can see
- Respects strength above all else
- Capable of being genuinely shocked (the lightning incident)
