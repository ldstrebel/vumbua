# Iggy

> *"Where am I?"*

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Origin** | Unknown (possibly [[trench-kin|Trench-Kin]]) |
| **Rank** | 🥇 Gold (receipt was... used as a tissue) |
| **Class** | Daggerheart Character |
| **Player** | Holly |
| **Housing** | [[block-12|Block 12]] (with [[ignatius|Ignatius]]) |

## Appearance

Iggy has a **slimy** quality—enough that when he reached into the receipt printer, the attendant recoiled: "It's already gross. Oh, it's so gross." His physiology produces mucus or slime.

## Personality

Iggy is **bewildered, curious, and unconventional**. He navigates the world with a child-like wonder that sometimes causes chaos—like destroying a testing cubicle's throughput by using the receipt paper as a tissue.

**Key Traits:**
- Constantly confused about his surroundings
- Curious to the point of causing problems — prone to "shiny penny" moments
- Secretly enjoys being included — when invited to the bonfire he was thrilled, but he'll never admit it
- His grumpy side emerges when people interfere with what he wants to do
- Not anti-social, just unaccustomed to attention
- "If you have a god, please pray" - what attendants say after meeting him
- Physically unusual enough to require supervisor intervention

**Core Motivation:** Despite his home never serving him well, Iggy deeply cares for his people and his clan. His ultimate goal is gathering information that could help the Trench. He's the unsung hero type who will never stop trying to help, even if no one appreciates it.

## Background

Iggy's origins are deliberately mysterious. He may be connected to the **[[trench-kin|Trench-Kin]]**—an uncontacted clan that players don't yet know about.

- Parents were on the council — gave him access to most places in the Trench
- Found the obsidian tablet (sent by [[ash-bloods|Ash-Bloods]] rejecting the Exchange; see [[ash-bloods#The Broken Exchange|Ash-Bloods]])
- Didn't fit in with the normal crowd — always the odd one out
- Has a hidden "treasure trove" of collected trinkets and findings
- Has never been caught sneaking anywhere — combination of parental access, nobody caring, and a natural ability to blend in
- "The nature of his people — they're so one with the soil, they are part of the earth" — he's not clumsy

### What He Doesn't Know
- Basically everything about how civilization works
- What a receipt is
- Where he is
- Why things work the way they do

### What He Now Knows (Session 2.5)
- The [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] measures Harmony's total ether power — and it's declining
- The Ash-Blood integration only produced ~20 amps (expected +300 to +800)
- Crystal batteries (Panda 5) are surge regulators, not storage
- Integration works through cultural connection, not resource extraction
- The Night of Sparks burned the world for two months before umber crystals existed
- "Trail tales from the Trench" — his people are known to Harmony as border defenders
- His worldview is being challenged: he was told connection with the outside world would destroy his people, but Kante argues the opposite

## Skills & Abilities

**Daggerheart Mechanics (revised in Session 2.5):**
- **Passive stealth** — a stress-triggered blending ability he doesn't realize he's using. When stressed, he unconsciously blends into his surroundings. He may crash and wake up in a random place a day later.
- **Active earth manipulation** — spending hope to intentionally move or shape earth, tied to hyperfixation states
- **Strange Patterns:** When Iggy rolls a **7** on either die, he gains a hope and clears a stress

**Natural Talents:**
- Exceptional technical/mechanical intuition — figured out battery design philosophy before Kante explained it
- Detailed sketching and note-taking
- Natural stealth (earth-bonded physiology)

## Inventory

## GM Notes [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### True Origin: Trench-Kin [MAJOR SECRET]

Iggy is likely from the **[[trench-kin|Trench-Kin]]**—one of the uncontacted clans. This origin is hidden from other players and should be revealed through gameplay.

### Plot Hooks
- His bewilderment is genuine—he's from an entirely different society
- His slimy nature may connect to deep-sea or underground origins
- Harmony may not even realize what they've let into the academy
- His "innocence" could be a mask or genuine naivety
- **(Session 2.5):** Holly confirmed Iggy genuinely cares for his people despite them never caring for him. He's not a spy — he's an earnest oddball who wants to bring knowledge home to help. His "infiltration" is just a kid walking through an unlocked door because nobody told him he couldn't.

### Secret Character Arc
- Discovery of his true heritage
- Why did he come to Vumbua?
- What do the [[trench-kin|Trench-Kin]] want?
- Is his confusion an act or genuine?
