# Iggy

> *"Where am I?"*

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Origin** | Unknown |
| **Ancestry** | Earthkin |
| **Rank** | Gold (receipt was... used as a tissue) |
| **Class** | Daggerheart Character |
| **Player** | Holly |
| **Housing** | [[Block 12]] (with [[Ignatius]]) |

## Appearance

Semi-human shaped, but his limbs are made of packed dirt — he looks like he's constantly crumbling. Giant bug eyes that he has to wear **goggles** over, constantly injecting fluid into them with a syringe to keep the pressure right. Extremely light-sensitive — starts **steaming** in sunlight and is always applying a version of sunscreen, grabbing at things to cover himself. Produces slime and mucus. Pressure-sensitive — feels relief when weight is applied (the heavy trench coat settled him immediately). Wears a dark, heavy trench coat given to him by a stranger on the docks when he first emerged.

## Personality

Iggy is **bewildered, curious, and unconventional**. He navigates the world with a child-like wonder that sometimes causes chaos — like destroying a testing cubicle's throughput by using the receipt paper as a tissue. Inspired by **The Mole from Atlantis** — grumpy, comedic, chronically sickly.

**Key Traits:**
- Constantly confused about his surroundings — genuinely doesn't know how civilization works
- Curious to the point of causing problems — prone to "shiny penny" moments
- Secretly enjoys being included — when invited to the bonfire he was thrilled, but he'll never admit it
- His grumpy side emerges when people interfere with what he wants to do
- Not anti-social, just unaccustomed to attention
- Incredibly secretive — lots of mumbling to himself, cursing at steaming, covering his tracks
- "If you have a god, please pray" — what attendants say after meeting him
- Takes zigzagging, indirect routes everywhere to absorb information
- Deeply cares for his people despite them never caring for him

## Background

Iggy's origins are mysterious — even to himself. He emerged from the water near the docks and was given a trench coat by a stranger before making his way to the academy. He covers his tracks obsessively and doesn't want anyone to trace where he came from.

- Parents were on the council — gave him access to most places back home
- Found an obsidian tablet sent by the [[Ash-Bloods]] rejecting something called the Exchange
- Didn't fit in with the normal crowd — always the odd one out
- Has a hidden "treasure trove" of collected trinkets and findings
- Has never been caught sneaking anywhere — combination of parental access, nobody caring, and a natural ability to blend in
- "The nature of his people — they're so one with the soil, they are part of the earth"

### What He Doesn't Know
- Basically everything about how civilization works
- What a receipt is
- Where he is
- Why things work the way they do

### What He Now Knows (Session 2.5)
- The [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] measures Harmony's total ether power — and it's declining
- The Ash-Blood integration only produced ~20 amps (expected +300 to +800)
- Crystal batteries (Panda 5) are surge regulators, not storage
- Integration works through cultural connection, not resource extraction
- The Night of Sparks burned the world for two months before umber crystals existed
- "Trail tales from the Trench" — his people are known to Harmony as border defenders
- His worldview is being challenged: he was told connection with the outside world would destroy his people, but [[Professor Kante]] argues the opposite

## Skills & Abilities

**Daggerheart Mechanics (revised in Session 2.5):**
- **Passive stealth** — a stress-triggered blending ability he doesn't realize he's using. When stressed, he unconsciously blends into his surroundings. He may crash and wake up in a random place a day later.
- **Active earth manipulation** — spending hope to intentionally move or shape earth, tied to hyperfixation states
- **Strange Patterns:** When Iggy rolls a **7** on either die, he gains a hope and clears a stress

**Natural Talents:**
- Exceptional technical/mechanical intuition — figured out battery design philosophy before Kante explained it
- Detailed sketching and note-taking
- Natural stealth (earth-bonded physiology)
- Information absorption — takes winding routes specifically to observe everything

## Inventory

## Quest Tracker

> What Iggy believes his quest to be, based on what's happened in-session.

### Session 0 — Emergence
Iggy emerged from the water, covering his tracks immediately. He doesn't want anyone to know where he came from. His motivation: absorb as much information as possible about this overwhelming new world. He takes the most complicated, zigzagging routes to take everything in while making sure nobody can follow him back.

### Session 1 — Survival
Got Gold rank (not that he understands what that means). His receipt was used as a tissue. The world above is loud, bright, and confusing. He asked "Where am I?" and meant it. His immediate quest is just to survive and figure out how things work here. He wants to "find out things" and walks around on his own terms. He climbed a crane because he wanted to touch the sky.

### Session 2 — Belonging (Quietly)
Secretly enjoyed being included at the bonfire. Socialized with the group. Noticed Ignatius looking back at him as he left — a small connection forming. Then Irish-goodbyed when nobody was actively talking to him.

### Session 2.5 — The Turning Point
Everything changed. Wandered into the power plant and met [[Professor Kante]], who validated his technical intuition. Learned that the world's power (Global Amplitude) is declining and that integration — cultural connection between peoples — is how it's restored. This directly contradicts everything he was taught: that connection with the outside world would destroy his people. Now Iggy has a real question to answer: *Was he lied to, or is Kante wrong?* He designed five experiments to test "connection" with people at the [[Celestial Lounge]]. He has a mentor, an umber crystal, and for the first time, a reason to stay.
