# Ignatius

> *"Why did all the elders leave?"*

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Clan** | [[ash-bloods|Ash-Bloods]] |
| **Rank** | 🥈 Silver |
| **Class** | Daggerheart Character |
| **Player** | John |
| **Housing** | [[block-12|Block 12]] (with [[iggy|Iggy]]) |

## Appearance

An [[ember|Ember]] Islander with **literal flames**—covered in soot with fire as a natural part of his being. When asked what gave away his origin, the answer was obvious: "Was it the soot or the literal flames?"

## Personality

Ignatius carries a **facade of confidence** that can melt away when confronted with the overwhelming reality of Harmony's scale. He's politically minded for a teenager—passionate about his clan's independence but without full understanding of how the world works.

**Key Traits:**
- Idealistic about [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Blood]] independence
- Views Harmony relationship as a partnership, not subservience
- Culturally proud—almost Hawaiian in sentiment
- "Classic teenager with strong political ideals who doesn't really know how the world works"

## Background

From the [[Ash-Blood Isles|Ember Isles]], Ignatius witnessed the integration ceremony that brought the [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Bloods]] into Harmony as full citizens. He watched as [[lady-ignis|Lady Ignis]]—his clan's matriarch—rose to sudden prominence.

### The Integration Ceremony
Ignatius attended the **Stitching ceremony** where:
- An obsidian cooking stone and Harmony battery cooked meat side by side
- When they took the first bite, the volcano came alive
- [[lady-ignis|Lady Ignis]] gained enormous status and resources (airship, sea vessel, iron walker)
- The [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Bloods]] became quasi-famous in Harmony

### What He Knows
- Lady Ignis is now someone extremely important in Harmony
- The volcano's reaction to the Integration was significant
- Captain Elara Thorne discovered the [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Blood]] islands
- The relationship should be a "partnership" not exploitation

### What He Questions
- Why did the elders leave?
- Why is this integration such a big deal for Harmony?
- Is the clan being taken advantage of?

- [[lomi|Lomi]] encouraged him with a critical-success roll
- [[serra-vox|Serra Vox]] asked about [[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]] physiology; Ignatius explained heat release via burning hotter
- Discussed [[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]] politics with [[serra-vox|Serra Vox]]; learned about the [[Inverse Power Doctrine]] and [[lady-ignis|Lady Ignis]]'s role
- Expressed traditionalist views on fire and [[ember|Ember]]'s modernizer rejection
- Called [[zephyr|Zephyr]] "Lightning Girl" after her purple lightning bolt; she called him "Lava Boy" via [[rill|Rill]]
