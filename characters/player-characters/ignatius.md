# Ignatius

> *"Why did all the elders leave?"*

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Clan** | [[Ash-Bloods]] |
| **Rank** | Silver |
| **Class** | Daggerheart Character |
| **Player** | John |
| **Housing** | [[Block 12]] (with [[Iggy]]) |

## Appearance

An [[Ember]] Islander with **literal flames** — fire is a natural part of his being, and soot covers him from his long travels. When [[Lance]] asked what gave away his origin: *"Was it the soot or the literal flames?"* The soot isn't permanent — it's from how far he's traveled overland to reach Harmony. As he put it: "We're not barbarians. We clean ourselves. I've just been traveling for a long time." He plays into it sometimes, but the flames are always there.

## Personality

Ignatius carries a **facade of confidence** that can melt away when confronted with the overwhelming reality of Harmony's scale — his first roll was a fear roll as he processed the sheer size of Vumbua. He's politically minded for a teenager: passionate about his clan's independence but without full understanding of how the world works. He's idealistic in the way that someone who hasn't been tested yet can be.

**Key Traits:**
- Idealistic about [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Blood]] independence — wants partnership, not subservience
- Culturally proud — deeply tied to the Ash-Blood clan's traditions and volcanic heritage
- "Classic teenager with strong political ideals who doesn't really know how the world works"
- Traditionalist — annoyed at [[Ember]]'s modernizer stance, believes in the old fire
- Confident facade that cracks under pressure — then rebuilds quickly
- Named the fuel rocks "[[Leidian]]" himself (lava + obsidian combined)
- Has a hot temper — literally and figuratively (lit the bonfire prematurely out of instinct)
- Funny without always meaning to be — the "Lava Boy" exchange was earnest on his end

## Background

From the [[Ash-Blood Isles|Ember Isles]], Ignatius witnessed the integration ceremony that brought the [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Bloods]] into Harmony as full citizens. He watched as [[Lady Ignis]] — his clan's matriarch — rose to sudden prominence. But he views the whole thing with suspicion: Harmony's fuel is "fake stuff," and the clan is trading away its identity for trinkets.

He got in trouble exploring areas he wasn't supposed to be in. The elders banished him to "the trial of adventure" — but Ignatius reframed it on his own terms: *"No, this is simply a pilgrimage."* He arrived in Harmony with a backpack on his shoulder, in awe of everything, knowing one thing for certain: he's going to find a new source of heat for the clan and prove that the old ways are right.

### The Integration Ceremony
Ignatius attended the **Stitching ceremony** where:
- An obsidian cooking stone and Harmony battery cooked meat side by side
- When they took the first bite, the volcano came alive
- [[Lady Ignis]] gained enormous status and resources (airship, sea vessel, iron walker)
- The [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Bloods]] became quasi-famous in Harmony

### What He Knows
- Lady Ignis is now someone extremely important in Harmony
- The volcano's reaction to the Integration was significant
- Captain Elara Thorne discovered the [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Blood]] islands
- The relationship should be a "partnership" not exploitation
- The fuel his people produce — what he calls [[Leidian]] — powers the academy's boilers
- Ash-Blood physiology releases heat by burning hotter — it doesn't build up

### What He Questions
- Why did the elders leave?
- Why is this integration such a big deal for Harmony?
- Is the clan being taken advantage of?
- Why is the volcano reheating?

## Skills & Experiences

- **Fire manipulation** — literal flames are part of his being; can light things instantly
- **Heat management** — understands Ash-Blood physiology and how heat release works
- **Volcanic knowledge** — knows about [[Leidian]] (lava + obsidian), volcanic systems, and the clan's relationship to fire
- **Exploration instinct** — got in trouble for exploring forbidden areas back home; driven to discover
- **Cultural knowledge** — deep understanding of Ash-Blood traditions, the Stitching ceremony, and clan politics

## Inventory

| Item | Source | Notes |

## Quest Tracker

> What Ignatius believes his quest to be, based on what's happened in-session.

### Session 0 — The Pilgrimage
Ignatius was banished by the elders for exploring forbidden areas, but he reframed it: *"No, this is simply a pilgrimage."* His core quest from the start: find a new source of heat for the clan and prove that the Harmony fuel is fake. *"I'm going to find the new source of heat for the clan and everything's going to go back to the way it should be."* He arrived in Harmony with conviction.

### Session 1 — The Scale of It
The facade of confidence cracked when he saw Vumbua — the massive ships, the construction, the sheer scale. First fear roll of the game. Met Lance, who recognized him instantly ("Was it the soot or the literal flames?"). The handshake test: Lance wanted to know if Ignatius's hand would burn him. It didn't. Getting oriented in a world much bigger than the Ember Isles.

### Session 2 — Declaring His Quest
The bonfire was Ignatius's moment. He lit it prematurely (instinct, not showing off), panicked Cassius, but it became a great moment when Lomi helped smooth things over. Then he stated his quest openly: *"I want to find the heart of the volcano. The next [[Leidian]] deposit. I want to find out why it's reheating."* He named the fuel rocks himself — Leidian (lava + obsidian). He's a traditionalist: annoyed at Ember's modernizing, skeptical of Serra Vox's interest. The "Lava Boy" nickname from Zephyr/Rill stuck. His quest is clear and public now.
