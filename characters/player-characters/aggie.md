# Aggie

> *"When things stop dying, we start dying."*

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Clan** | [[Mizizi|Mizizi (Root-Kin)]] |
| **Rank** | Silver |
| **Class** | Daggerheart Character |
| **Player** | Christina (Kristina) |
| **Housing** | [[Block 04]] (with [[Britt]]) |

## Appearance

A turtle-mushroom hybrid of the [[Mizizi]] clan. Shape-wise turtle, but colors and textures lean heavily fungal — her shell is the **red-and-white spotted mushroom** (like an Amanita cap), which she can retreat fully into. Medium-small eyes. Moss, mycelia, and fungal growths are natural features. She described herself as leaning "on the mushroom side" — softer textures, vibrant coloring distinct from [[Britt]]'s gray/dusty look.

## Personality

Aggie is **cautious, curious, and quietly suspicious**. Compared to [[Britt]], she's less aggressive in her questioning of Harmony, but she shares the same core concerns. She's wary in a quiet, accusatory way — she believes Harmony is responsible for something, she just doesn't know what yet. She goes with the flow while keeping her eyes open, and gravitates toward dark corners and safe spots when overwhelmed.

**Key Traits:**
- Thoughtful and observant — watches before she acts
- Less confrontational than [[Britt]], but shares the same suspicions
- Diplomatic instinct — "just trying to be nice to everyone, not piss anyone off"
- Gravitates toward comfort zones — looks for dark, fungal-feeling spaces when stressed
- Curious enough to want to explore: "Curiosity is growing. She wants to see more."
- Shares concerns privately rather than voicing them openly
- The quieter investigator to Britt's louder agitator

## Background

Like [[Britt]], Aggie grew up in the [[Mizizi Petrified Forest|Petrified Forest]] with the [[Mizizi]] clan's unique death-and-decay philosophy. She and Britt are cousins — same year at "turtle camp" — who bonded over shared gossip and concerns about Harmony. They weren't best friends growing up (different social groups), but their shared suspicions drew them closer, and now they have a mission together.

Aggie's approach is different from Britt's: where Britt wants to infiltrate and confront, Aggie wants to observe and uncover the conspiracy quietly. She believes Harmony is responsible for what's happening to their people — she just needs proof.

### What She Knows
- The forest has stopped dying naturally, causing deep concern
- Harmony has been trading with the [[Mizizi]] elders — tools and weapons for forest materials
- Her clan's relationship with outsiders is new and uncertain
- The clan's lore says the forest keeps them apart from the world for a reason
- The mycelium highway network connects their forest homeland

### Approach
- More diplomatic than [[Britt]] — prefers observation to confrontation
- Shares Britt's concerns but voices them more privately
- Suspects Harmony is responsible for the forest's crisis — looking for evidence

## Skills & Experiences

- **Mycelium navigation** — can travel the fungal highway network of the Petrified Forest
- **Observation** — patient, detail-oriented, picks up on things others miss
- **Diplomacy** — navigates social situations without making enemies
- **Stealth and stillness** — retreats into her shell or dark spaces when threatened; blends into fungal environments

## Quest Tracker

> What Aggie believes her quest to be, based on what's happened in-session.

### Session 0 — The Conspiracy
Aggie and Britt are in cahoots: something is wrong with the Harmony relationship, and they're going to find out what. Aggie's approach is quieter — she's the observer, the one who will "uncover the conspiracy" through watching and listening. She believes Harmony is responsible somehow, but she doesn't know how yet. She's here to find proof.

### Session 1 — Keeping a Low Profile
Got Silver rank. When Britt got special attention at the checkpoint for her Gold rank, Aggie's instinct was to be nice, stay quiet, and not draw attention. She's overwhelmed by the scale of everything but curiosity is growing — she wants to do at least "a lap around the buildings" to take it all in. She's cataloguing everything.

### Session 2 — The Bonfire
Serra Vox's approach was unsettling — being studied as an anthropological curiosity isn't comfortable. Rill's recognition felt different — warmer, more familiar. The invitation to visit after class is the first real lead. The bonfire exposed how much bigger this world is than the forest. The quest remains: observe, learn, find the truth.

## Session Appearances

### [[session-00|Session 0]] — Character Creation
- Confirmed fate of being in the same clan as [[Britt]] ("This was fate!")
- Established as the quieter, more observational half of the pair
- Appearance: red-and-white spotted mushroom-turtle shell
- Defined shared gossip relationship with [[Britt]] about Harmony
- Christina's framing: "skeptical in a more quiet, suspicious way" — going to uncover the conspiracy

### [[session-01|Session 1]] — Arrival at [[Vumbua Academy]]
- Took the entrance exam in a cubicle near Britt
- Was still testing when Britt finished — Britt caused a scene to stall for her
- Finished just in time after Britt's distraction
- Made it through the checkpoint without incident — diplomatic, polite
- When the crowds thinned: curiosity growing, wanted to explore and "do a lap"

### [[session-02|Session 2]] — The Bonfire
- [[Serra Vox]] approached her and [[Britt]] at the [[Block 99]] bonfire
- [[Rill]] recognized her and [[Britt]]; invited them to visit after class tomorrow
