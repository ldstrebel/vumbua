# Lomi — GM Notes

> [!warning]
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

## Plot Hooks
- His Harmony native perspective can provide exposition to clan characters
- His labor connections may tie into the academy's infrastructure
- Copper rank means he'll need to prove himself more than others
- His boiler background may connect to Harmony's power systems

## Unique Value
- Lomi serves as the "insider" who can explain Harmony culture
- His practical mindset contrasts with the idealism of clan characters

## Session Notes

### Session 0
- Luke F described Lomi as half-Earthkin, half-human — distant ancestry ("great-grandfather was an Earthkin"). Mechanically Earthkin/human split but it's a distant past thing. He looks perpetually dirty — "you don't really know where skin ends and where dirt begins" (like Pigpen from Peanuts).
- Comes from a long line of boiler workers — family has the original boiler schematics hung up in their living room.
- His family and co-workers pushed him to apply: "Someone's got to fix the ship if it goes wrong."
- He transferred with the academy — was maintenance crew during construction. He saw the academy go from "just a boat and a ship" to a functioning campus.

### Session 1
- His improvisation about "noises in the boiler room" was a perfect character beat — it covered for Iggy's true nature while staying in-character as a working-class guy who hears weird things on the job.
- The attendant told him: "You are a Copper. It is always good to know your options." — potential leverage point if Lomi ever needs a fallback career.

### Session 2
- Established as a smooth talker — comfortable with both the working class (Sarge/Lucky) and the upper-crust (Percy).
- His "Boiler Maker family" introduction was a great character moment.
