# Iggy — GM Notes

> [!warning]
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

## True Origin: Trench-Kin [MAJOR SECRET]

Iggy is from the **[[Trench-Kin]]** — one of the uncontacted clans. This origin is hidden from other players and should be revealed through gameplay.

## Plot Hooks
- His bewilderment is genuine — he's from an entirely different society
- His slimy nature may connect to deep-sea or underground origins
- Harmony may not even realize what they've let into the academy
- His "innocence" could be a mask or genuine naivety
- **(Session 2.5):** Holly confirmed Iggy genuinely cares for his people despite them never caring for him. He's not a spy — he's an earnest oddball who wants to bring knowledge home to help. His "infiltration" is just a kid walking through an unlocked door because nobody told him he couldn't.

## Secret Character Arc
- Discovery of his true heritage
- Why did he come to Vumbua?
- What do the [[Trench-Kin]] want?
- Is his confusion an act or genuine?

## Session Notes

### Session 0
- Holly's character concept: inspired by The Mole from Atlantis — grumpy, comedic, chronically sickly
- Earthkin ancestry — "semi-human shaped, but limbs are made out of packed dirt and just looks like he's constantly crumbling"
- Giant bug eyes requiring goggles he keeps injecting fluid into to pressurize
- Extremely light-sensitive — starts steaming in sunlight, constantly applying sunscreen
- Pressure-sensitive — feels relief when weight is applied (the trench coat scene)
- Holly: "He doesn't want anything being tracked back to where he popped out of"
- Takes zigzagging routes to absorb information while covering his tracks
- The blood exchange/bride ceremony: his clan participates — "they just jump into the water and then you pull them down"

### Session 2.5
- **Mechanics revision:** GM and Holly discussed changing Iggy's wizard subclass abilities. New concept: passive stealth (stress-triggered blending he doesn't realize he's using) + active earth manipulation (hope-spend hyperfixation). Strange Patterns: when Iggy rolls a 7 on either die, he gains a hope and clears a stress.
- Holly's key insight: "If connection is so important, why does the Exchange force people to forget?" — this is the exact right question that neither Kante nor Harmony has considered.
- Iggy's takeaway is confusion: he's been told his whole life that connection with the outside world would make his world die. Kante is telling him the complete opposite.
- Kante's mention of "trail tales from the Trench" confirms the Trench-Kin are known to Harmony as border defenders, but he doesn't connect Iggy to them.
- **Critical dramatic irony:** Iggy is Trench-Kin — one of the "missing siblings" whose unintegrated status may be contributing to the Ash-Blood Anomaly. If Kante knew what Iggy was, the mystery might be half-solved.
