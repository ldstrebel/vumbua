# Ignatius — GM Notes

> [!warning]
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

## Plot Hooks
- His political idealism may clash with Harmony realpolitik
- [[Lady Ignis]]'s sudden prominence hides deeper political machinations
- The volcano's reaction to the Integration has mystical significance
- His flame nature marks him as a constant visual reminder of clan identity

## Secret Knowledge
- The Integration ceremony connected [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Blood]] volcanic power to Harmony's grid
- [[Lady Ignis]]'s power comes with strings attached

## Session Notes

### Session 0
- John described Ignatius as a "classic teenager who has very strong political ideals who doesn't really know how the world works"
- He views the Harmony relationship as: "We're subbing out our own fuel for this fake stuff. It's all fake. It's all wrong."
- Got in trouble exploring areas he wasn't supposed to be in — elders "banished him to this trial of adventure"
- Ignatius reframed it: "No, this is simply a pilgrimage."
- His core quest from the start: "I'm going to find the new source of heat for the clan and everything's going to go back to the way it should be."
- John compared the cultural sentiment to "a hyperbole of some Hawaiian sentiment" — culturally tied to the Ash-Blood clan, wants independence/partnership not subservience.
- The Stitching ceremony: obsidian cooking stone vs. Harmony battery cooking meat side-by-side. When they took the first bite, the volcano came alive again.

### Session 1
- First fear roll of the game — his "facade of confidence walking in just melts away" when processing the scale of Vumbua.
- The soot: "That's not a normal thing for him to always be covered in soot. It's just because of how far he's traveled." He plays into it sometimes, but "we're not barbarians. We clean ourselves."

### Session 2
- Revealed his core drive openly: "I want to find the heart of the volcano. The next Leidian deposit. I want to find out *why* it's reheating."
- Named the fuel rocks "Leidian" (lava + obsidian combined)
- Expressed traditionalist views — annoyed at Ember's modernizer stance
- The "Lava Boy" nickname from Zephyr/Rill was a good character moment.
