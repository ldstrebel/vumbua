# Britt — GM Notes

> [!warning]
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

## Plot Hooks
- Her Gold rank may attract attention from faculty or other factions
- Her suspicions about Harmony could lead to uncovering uncomfortable truths
- The [[Mizizi]] forest's petrification may be connected to larger world events

## Secret Knowledge
- The Petrified Forest may be more than just dead wood — it could be a data archive
- Harmony's interest in the [[Mizizi]] goes deeper than simple trade
- The "destroy the forest" bargain is mutual ignorance: Harmony doesn't know it's a library; Mizizi think they're preventing apocalypse

## Session Notes

### Session 0
- Sophie explicitly framed Britt as eager to go not for adventure, but as an infiltrator: "The call is coming from inside the house" — she's going to discover what's wrong from inside Harmony.
- Sophie described her character as "cynical, angry" — more passionate and suspicious than Aggie.
- Appearance: gray, dusty, powdery fungal-turtle. Related to Aggie (cousins). Medium-small eyes, not quite red.

### Session 1
- Sophie explicitly stated Britt is "unintentionally very, very good in class" — she doesn't try to excel academically, it just happens. Her main interest is the political ramifications of the Academy and "what is hiding below the surface."
- Her instinct to stall for Aggie during the exam showed protective nature and quick thinking.
- Immediate distrust of Dean Isolde: "I don't trust this f***ing guy."

### Session 2
- Failed charm roll against Serra Vox (Fear) — Serra shut down and deflected. This establishes that Britt's direct approach doesn't always work.
- Britt's suspicion is well-founded per GM notes. The forest destruction is a tragedy in progress.
