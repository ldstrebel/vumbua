# Aggie — GM Notes

> [!warning]
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

## Plot Hooks
- Her more diplomatic nature may make her useful in faction politics
- May uncover information through observation rather than confrontation
- Her bond with [[Britt]] creates natural tension when their approaches conflict

## Session Notes

### Session 0
- Christina described Aggie as "skeptical in a more quiet, suspicious" way — wary of Harmony and the tech, "accusatory... they're responsible somehow but how" — going to uncover the conspiracy.
- She's the quieter half of the pair, but shares the same core concerns.
- Appearance: red-and-white spotted mushroom-turtle. Shape-wise turtle but colors/textures on the mushroom side. The shell is like a red-and-white spotted mushroom she can retreat into.

### Session 1
- Aggie's approach when overwhelmed: "looking for a darker corner or wall... looking for that safe spot" — retreats to comfort (fungal/dark spaces).
- When Britt got special attention at the checkpoint (Gold rank), Aggie's reaction was to "just be nice to everyone, not piss anyone off" — diplomatic instinct.
- When the crowds thinned: "Curiosity is growing. She wants to see more. At least do a lap around the buildings."
