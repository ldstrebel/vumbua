| **Player** | Sophie |
| **Housing** | [[block-04|Block 04]] (with [[aggie|Aggie]]) |

## Appearance

A turtle-mushroom hybrid of the [[mizizi|Mizizi]] clan—a mixture of sturdy shell and fungal growths. The Mizizi physiology includes moss, shell, and mycelia as natural features.

## Personality

Britt is **sure-footed and observant**. Where her clanmate [[aggie|Aggie]] might be swept along by the crowd, Britt holds her own—throwing elbows when necessary to push through. She's protective of those close to her and quick to think on her feet.

**Key Traits:**
- Resourceful under pressure
- Protective of [[aggie|Aggie]]
- Observant of her surroundings
- Willing to bend rules when needed (held down her test flag to wait for Aggie)

## Background

Born in the [[Mizizi Petrified Forest|Petrified Forest]] of the [[mizizi|Mizizi]] homeland, Britt grew up with the clan's unique philosophy on death and decay. When Harmony arrived and began working with the elders, Britt was among those selected to attend [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]].

### What She Knows
- The forest has been "not dying" which is deeply concerning to her people
- Harmony trades weapons and tools in exchange for forest materials

- Previous [[mizizi|Mizizi]] youth attended Vumbua last cycle

### Suspicions

- More aggressive in her questioning than [[aggie|Aggie]]
