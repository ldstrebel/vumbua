# Britt

> *"When things stop dying, we start dying."*

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Clan** | [[Mizizi|Mizizi (Root-Kin)]] |
| **Rank** | Gold |
| **Class** | Daggerheart Character |
| **Player** | Sophie |
| **Housing** | [[Block 04]] (with [[Aggie]]) |

## Appearance

A turtle-mushroom hybrid of the [[Mizizi]] clan. Shape-wise turtle, but colors and textures are distinctly fungal — **gray, dusty, and powdery**, like dried spore-covered bark. Her shell is sturdy enough to bump desks and knock things over. Medium-small eyes, not quite red. She can retreat into her shell. Moss, mycelia, and fungal growths are natural features of her physiology.

## Personality

Britt is **sure-footed, outspoken, and fiercely protective**. Where her cousin [[Aggie]] might be swept along by the crowd, Britt holds her own — throwing elbows when necessary to push through. She's the more aggressive of the pair: cynical, passionate, and suspicious of Harmony's motives. She's also **unintentionally very, very good in class** — her academic talent is incidental to her real interests, which are political.

**Key Traits:**
- Resourceful under pressure — quick-thinking and adaptable
- Protective of [[Aggie]] — will cause a scene to wait for her
- Outspoken and confrontational — not afraid to voice suspicions
- Cynical about Harmony's motives — "the call is coming from inside the house"
- Academically gifted without trying — her main interest is the political underbelly
- Willing to bend rules when needed (held down her test flag, lied about the receipt)
- Immediate distrust of authority: *"I don't trust this f***ing guy"* (about the Dean)

## Background

Born in the [[Mizizi Petrified Forest|Petrified Forest]] of the [[Mizizi]] homeland, Britt grew up with the clan's unique philosophy on death and decay — *when things stop dying, we start dying*. When Harmony arrived on the shore and began working with the elders, Britt watched with suspicion as "the paperman" brought tools and weapons in exchange for forest materials. She and [[Aggie]] are cousins, same year at "turtle camp," who bonded over shared concerns about what Harmony really wants.

Britt didn't come to the academy for adventure. She came because *something is wrong*, and she can't discover what from the outside. She's here to infiltrate — or at least to investigate from within.

### What She Knows
- The forest has been "not dying" which is deeply concerning to her people
- Harmony trades weapons and tools in exchange for forest materials (soil, roots, bark, stone)
- The elders made deals with "the paperman" from Harmony — a man in a sterile outfit with metal on it
- Previous [[Mizizi]] youth attended Vumbua last cycle
- The clan uses the mycelium highway network to travel through the forest
- The clan's lore says the forest exists to keep them apart from the world — "when the world comes, things stop dying"

### Suspicions
- Something is fundamentally wrong with the Harmony relationship
- The elders are distributing Harmony's tools without understanding the full picture
- The academy isn't what it seems — "What is hiding below the surface? Because something is."

## Skills & Experiences

- **Mycelium navigation** — can travel the fungal highway network of the Petrified Forest
- **Observational instincts** — reads situations quickly, picks up on threats and patterns
- **Physical resilience** — sure-footed, sturdy shell, holds her own in crowds
- **Social intelligence** — knows when to push and when to hold back (even if she doesn't always hold back)
- **Academic aptitude** — unintentionally excels at coursework

## Quest Tracker

> What Britt believes her quest to be, based on what's happened in-session.

### Session 0 — The Mission
Britt and Aggie are in cahoots: *something is wrong* with the Harmony relationship, and they're going to find out what. "The call is coming from inside the house." They're going to save their families and their people. This isn't an adventure — it's a mission. Britt is the louder half of this partnership, the one who pushed to go.

### Session 1 — First Contact
The academy is overwhelming but Britt is holding her ground. Got Gold rank, which drew special attention at the checkpoint — she didn't like that. Her instinct was to grab Aggie and keep moving. The Dean's welcome speech felt wrong: *"I don't trust this f***ing guy."* Her main interest isn't the classes — it's the political ramifications of the Academy and what's hiding below the surface.

### Session 2 — Gathering Intel
Serra Vox approached her and Aggie at the bonfire, calling it "the most important anthropological cauldron in years" — Britt tried to charm her for more info but failed. Serra shut down. Rill recognized the Mizizi cousins and invited them to visit after class. The bonfire gave Britt a taste of how much she doesn't know about the wider world: missing clans, lightning powers, Ash-Blood politics. The investigation continues.

## Session Appearances

### [[session-00|Session 0]] — Character Creation

### [[session-01|Session 1]] — Arrival at [[Vumbua Academy]]
- Navigated the entrance exam crowd while staying close to [[Aggie]]

- Received special attention at the checkpoint (Gold rank acknowledged)
- Made it through to the academy grounds
- Sophie stated: Britt is "unintentionally very, very good in class" — her real interest is politics and what's below the surface

### [[session-02|Session 2]] — The Bonfire
- [[Serra Vox]] approached her and [[Aggie]] at the [[Block 99]] bonfire, calling it "the most important anthropological cauldron in years"
- Tried to charm [[Serra Vox]] for more info (Failure with Fear) — Serra shut down and deflected
