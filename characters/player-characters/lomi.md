# Lomi

> *"They paying you well here?"*

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Origin** | Harmony (Octoumba region) |
| **Ancestry** | Half-Earthkin, half-human (distant — great-grandfather was Earthkin) |
| **Rank** | Copper |
| **Class** | Daggerheart Character |
| **Player** | Luke F (Luke Foreman) |
| **Housing** | [[Block 99]]-Piston (with [[Ratchet]], [[Soot]]) |

## Appearance

Humanoid but perpetually dirty — you don't really know where skin ends and where dirt begins. Like Pigpen from Peanuts, there's always a cloud of grime and grease around him. He doesn't feel the need to shower after a shift. His Earthkin heritage is distant enough that he looks mostly human, but the connection to earth shows in a subtle, ever-present layer of soot and engine grease.

## Personality

Lomi is **practical, worker-conscious, and quick-witted**. His immediate instinct upon seeing the overwhelmed exam attendants was to check on their working conditions. He has strong ties to labor and the boiler worker community, and never misses a chance to remind people that the infrastructure doesn't maintain itself.

**Key Traits:**
- Union-minded ("family born and raised, boiler mega-union")
- Concerned about worker treatment — stops to chat with attendants, checks on conditions
- Smooth talker — comfortable with both the working class (Sarge, Lucky) and the upper-crust (Percy)
- Practical and observant — notices things others miss
- Down-to-earth despite the extraordinary circumstances
- Quick to improvise — his "noises in the boiler room" cover story was seamless
- Proud of public infrastructure: "This city would fall apart without people like Lomi"

## Background

Unlike the clan characters, Lomi is a **Harmony native** from the Octoumba continent — where the previous version of Vumbua was located. He comes from a **long line of boiler workers** — his family has the original boiler schematics hung up in their living room. He can trace his lineage all the way back to the founding of Harmony, where his ancestors built the first boiler.

He's been working as a maintenance person at the academy during its construction, watching it transform from "just a boat and a ship" to a functioning campus. His family and co-workers pushed him to apply for the explorer trials: *"Someone's got to fix the ship if it goes wrong."*

### What He Knows
- The academy (Vumbua) moves every 50 years to a new location
- The two main vessels (ironclad cruise ship and massive airship) form the academy's core
- Islands slowly drift toward each other over centuries
- The discovery of two new clans ([[Mizizi]] and [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Bloods]]) is the biggest news in a thousand years
- No major civilizations had been found in ages — only ancient bones
- The academy uses [[Leidian]] from the [[Ash-Blood Isles|Ash-Blood Isles]] to fuel the boilers

### The Explorer Dream
Like many Harmony citizens, Lomi has been swept up in the resurgence of explorer fever caused by the new discoveries. Getting Explorer rank is like becoming "an NFL star, a bull rider" — instant celebrity and lifetime government stipend. His family sees him as the "big smart guy" who works at the academy and figures he should make the jump.

## Skills & Experiences

- **Boiler operations** — lifetime of hands-on experience with furnaces, steam systems, and infrastructure
- **Mechanical knowledge** — deep familiarity with how Harmony's machines and power systems work
- **Social instincts** — reads people well, remembers shared experiences ("that one time you ordered a drink that was way too strong")
- **Improvisation** — quick on his feet when a cover story or smooth talk is needed
- **Infrastructure awareness** — understands how cities function at a systems level

## Inventory

| Item | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Engine Grease (moonshine) | Personal supply | Brought to the Block 99 bonfire |

## Quest Tracker

> What Lomi believes his quest to be, based on what's happened in-session.

### Session 0 — The Decision
Lomi has worked the boilers his whole life. The discovery of two new clans has reignited the dream of exploration across Harmony, and his family and co-workers pushed him to apply. His family's advice echoes: *"Someone's got to fix the ship if it goes wrong."* He's here to become an explorer — to see what's out there, and to make sure whatever ship takes him there keeps running.

### Session 1 — Getting Oriented
Got Copper rank — the lowest tier. Not discouraged. Settled into Block 99-Piston, recognized the steam stacks, and found familiar ground. Reconnected with Sarge from the construction campfires. The scale of the intake is overwhelming, but Lomi's treating it like any other job: show up, do the work, represent.

### Session 2 — Finding His People
The bonfire was the first real social event. Lomi secured moonshine, bonded with Percy over curiosity about the world, and helped light the fire alongside Ignatius. He's becoming the social glue of the group — the guy who can talk to anyone and make connections. His curiosity is growing. Percy's theories about missing clans and the noises Lomi "hears" in the boiler room are starting to make the world feel bigger than he expected.
