# Lomi

> *"They paying you well here?"*

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Origin** | Harmony (Octoumba region) |
| **Rank** | 🥉 Copper |
| **Class** | Daggerheart Character |
| **Player** | Luke F (Luke Foreman) |
| **Housing** | [[block-99|Block 99]]-Piston (with [[ratchet|Ratchet]], [[soot|Soot]]) |

## Appearance

A Harmony native—humanoid in appearance, fitting into the cosmopolitan society of the established civilization.

## Personality

Lomi is **practical and worker-conscious**. His immediate instinct upon seeing the overwhelmed exam attendants was to check on their working conditions. He has strong ties to labor and the boiler worker community.

**Key Traits:**
- Union-minded ("family born and raised boiler boiler mega union")
- Concerned about worker treatment
- Practical and observant
- Down-to-earth despite the extraordinary circumstances

## Background

Unlike the clan characters, Lomi is a **Harmony native** from the Octoumba continent—where the previous version of Vumbua was located. He's familiar with Harmony's culture and systems but still finds the new academy overwhelming.

### What He Knows
- The academy (Vumbua) moves every 50 years to a new location
- The two main vessels (ironclad cruise ship and massive airship) form the academy's core
- Islands slowly drift toward each other over centuries
- The discovery of two new clans ([[mizizi|Mizizi]] and [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Bloods]]) is the biggest news in a thousand years
- No major civilizations had been found in ages—only ancient bones

### The Explorer Dream
Like many Harmony citizens, Lomi has been swept up in the resurgence of explorer fever caused by the new discoveries. Getting Explorer rank is like becoming "an NFL star, a bull rider"—instant celebrity and lifetime government stipend.
