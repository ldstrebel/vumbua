# Taratannen Lore Dump

## World Setting: Harmony

**Campaign System:** Daggerheart (v1.5/1.6)  
**Theme:** Atlantis: The Lost Empire meets Magitek Steampunk.  
**Core Conflict:** Exploration vs. Stagnation.

### I. The Cosmology: The Great Stitching

The world is not a static globe; it is a disjointed reality waiting to be pulled together.

- **The Magnetic Pull:** Nodes act as gravity wells for reality. When a new Node is claimed and harmonized, it physically pulls the new continent slowly toward the central Harmony continent. The world is literally being built/stitched together over time.
- **The Threat (The Ether/Nether):** If civilization stops expanding, the reality of the claimed lands begins to dissolve. This has happened before, creating the "Dissolved Lands."
- **The Crisis (The Minimum):** For centuries, Harmony has had excess power. Now, for the first time, they are approaching "The Minimum." If they dip below this threshold, Harmony tech (lights, trains, medical devices) will begin to lose charge.

### II. The Hub: Vumbua Academy ("The Safiri")

*Name subject to change based on language preference.*  
The Academy is the heart of **The Harmony**. It is a mobile city-state that teleports to the frontier.

- **The Current State:** The Academy has just transferred to a massive new Terra with 2 potential Nodes. However, early scans suggest these Nodes are "shattered" or weak. They are not the savior battery Harmony hoped for.
- **The "Great Cull" Strategy:** Recognizing the desperation, the University has radically shifted its admissions policy.
  - **Class Size:** The largest in history.
  - **The Philosophy:** They expect 95% attrition during the "Trials" and another 20% loss during "Intern Voyages."
  - **The Goal:** Stop training "Glory Seekers" and start manufacturing "Survivalists."
- **Aesthetics:** High-Magitek. Brass, steam, crystal focusing lenses. But currently, the lights flicker occasionally—a secret terror for those who know why.

### III. The Explorer Castes

Harmony has two distinct types of explorers, often at odds:  
**1. The Vanguard (The Front Runners):**

- **Role:** They sail/ride off the edge of the map. They find where Nodes *likely* are.
- **Vibe:** Undisciplined, chaotic, glory-seeking. They rely on instinct. The map "unfurls" under their feet.
- **Reputation:** Rockstars, but unreliable.

**2. The Second Wave (The Grid-Makers):**

- **Role:** They take the chaotic maps of the Vanguard and verify them. They ensure no Node was missed.
- **Vibe:** Methodical, scientific, disciplined.
- **Reputation:** The "Cleaners." They are currently being prioritized by the Academy because the Vanguard has missed things in their arrogance.

### IV. The Factions

**1. The Harmony (The New Empire)**

- **Philosophy:** Expansion is life.
- **Strategic Paths:**
  1. **Assimilation:** Convince found Clans to join Harmony (boosts Node efficiency).
  2. **Discovery:** Find new Clans/Nodes in the Terra.
  3. **The Unknown:** Go completely off the chart to find raw, unclaimed power.
- **Harmony Tech:** Driven by "Crystal Batteries." These are links to the central network. They are designed to be power-capped to prevent overloads, but they are currently running lean.

**2. The Remnants (The Failed Empire)**  
These Clans stagnated because they stayed "Natural" and "Low Tech." They adapted to their specific biome but failed to stitch the world together.

- **Clan Tech:** Non-existent. They use specialized, nature-based efficiency (e.g., bioluminescence instead of lightbulbs, beast-labor instead of engines). They are incredibly efficient at *one thing* but lack the versatility of Harmony.

**A. The Volcano Clan (The Pyre-Keepers)**

- **Status:** Allied.
- **Biome:** Volcanic vents.
- **The Node:** Heat/Fire.
- **Motivations & Culture:**
  - **The Contract of Blood:** They maintain a strict exchange of bloodlines to prevent corruption and inbreeding.
  - **The Softening:** The Clan is physically thriving due to Harmony's medicine and food, but culturally, the elders fear they are becoming "soft." The Embers that used to require immense effort to heat a room now burn effortlessly with Harmony tech, making the youth complacent.
  - **The Belief:** "Keep the Nodes warm with companionship." They view the fire as a living entity that requires social presence to survive.
  - **The Fear:** If the world runs out of places to expand, the "Curse of Ash" will return, freezing their vents.

**B. The River Clan (The Wadi)**

- **Status:** Hostile / Isolationist.
- **Biome:** The "Dry Vein" (Desert Canyon).
- **The Node:** Water (Weak/Trickling).
- **History:**
  - **The Lost Bond:** They were once inextricably linked to the Air Clan. They lived *inside* the river walls, breathing via air bubbles provided by the Air Clan.
  - **The Collapse:** When the Old Empire fell, the Air Clan retreated, the bubbles stopped, and the river dried up. The survivors were forced into the canyon floor.
  - **Power Source:** They carry "Gems" that hold the residual environmental energy of their lost home.
- **Natural Adaptation:** They have evolved to retain water like cacti. They wear "Still-Suits" made of organic leather to reclaim moisture.

**C. The Air Clan (The Renali)**

- **Status:** Neutral / Elusive.
- **Biome:** The "Vapor Sea" (Floating Islands).
- **The Node:** Wind/Gravity.
- **Natural Adaptation:** They ride **Air-Bees** (Giant insects). They do not use engines; they use silk sails and insect pheromones to steer their islands.
- **Secret Strength:** They are "accidentally strong" because their meandering path creates micro-connections with other distant Nodes, keeping their magic surprisingly potent.
- **The "Bride Exchange" Ritual:**
  - Strict orders are given: Do not see the ground, do not speak, do not merge crystals.
  - Riders fly Air-Bees into the fog layer where visibility is zero.
  - They drop a Clan member into the mist and blindly snatch a rope holding a person from a ground clan (or another island).
  - This ensures genetic diversity without breaking their isolationist "flight" vow. The Air-Bees must *never* touch the ground.

**D. The Deep-Root Clan (The Mizizi) [New Natural Concept]**

- **Status:** Unknown / Dormant.
- **Biome:** The "Petrified Forest" or "Fungal Deep."
- **The Node:** Earth/Growth (Corrupted or Wild).
- **Natural Adaptation:** They live inside the hollowed-out fossilized roots of ancient mega-flora. They use fungal spores for communication and defense. They are the "recyclers" of the world.

### V. Map Zones & Geography

1. **The Vapor Sea:** The cloud layer separating the peaks. Requires airships or Air-Bees to cross.
2. **The Dry Vein:** The desert canyon of the River Clan.
3. **The Petrifaction Fields:** Where the Mizizi live. A forest turned to stone, now overgrown with massive fungi.
4. **Tartannen:** The mythical "First City" of the old empire, rumored to be somewhere in this sector.

### VI. Player Hooks (The Intake)

- **The Selection:** You are part of the massive intake. You are being tested not for your grades, but for your "Domain Resonance."
- **The Stakes:** The Instructors are harsh. "Look to your left, look to your right. Both of them will likely be dismissed by noon."
- **The Secret:** The Dean knows the power is failing. If this class doesn't find a strong Node, the lights at the Academy—and back home—will go out forever.

## Characters & Relationships

**Ignatius's Ash-Blood Contacts from Home**  
*Player Reference: NPCs Ignatius knew before leaving the Ember Isles*

**Clan Leadership**

- **Lady Ignis** (Relationship: Clan matriarch): You witnessed her at the Integration ceremony when the volcano roared to life; she led the elders to Harmony Prime.
- **Elder Char** (Relationship: Forge elder): One of the few elders who stayed behind; taught you metalwork and warned you about "The Cooling" before you left.
- **Priestess Ash** (Relationship: Keeper of the True Flame temple): She blessed your "pilgrimage" but warned you never to embrace Harmony's Safe-Flame (the teal, fake fire).

**Family & Friends**

- **Ember (Your Cousin)** (Relationship: Childhood friend and cousin): How You Know Them: You grew up together; your obsidian skin brightened at the same time during the Resurgence after integration.
- **Blaze** (Relationship: Friend's older sibling): Left for Vumbua Academy last year; their letters home inspired you to make the journey yourself.

**Craftspeople & Workers**

- **Forge-Master Sear** (Relationship: Head of the volcanic forges): Taught you fire-shaping and metalwork traditions; expects you to return with "new heat" for the clan.
- **The Obsidian Smith (Old Char)** (Relationship: Master craftsman): Crafted ceremonial obsidian for important clan rituals; gruff but respected by all.
- **Pyrrhus** (Relationship: Young engineer): Worked together in the home forges before Pyrrhus left for Vumbua to apply thermal expertise to Harmony's systems.

**Explorers & Travelers**

- **Scout Flare** (Relationship: Young scout): Traveled with Captain Elara Thorne's first expedition to Harmony; came back with stories that inspired your journey.
- **Scorch** (Relationship: Older clan member): Left for the Academy before you; sent warning messages back home about not letting Harmony "cool you down."

**Important Context**

- The **Integration ceremony** happened ~24 months ago when you witnessed the volcano roar to life.
- **Lady Ignis and most elders** left for Harmony Prime ~12 months ago.
- You're on a "pilgrimage" to **find new heat** for your clan (though the elders see it as banishment).
- The **Resurgence**: Since integration, Ash-Blood youth experience brightening skin instead of fading - proof the partnership works.

## Session 1: The Venture & The Vances

**Theme:** Atlantis meets Treasure Planet. High Polish vs. Grimy Reality.  
**Core Conflict:** The "Savants" (PCs) vs. The "System" (The Aristocrats).

**Scene 0: The Intake (The Hangar Pavilion)**  
**Atmosphere:** A sea of 100,000 bodies swarming the "Anchorage." The intake takes place within a cavernous, temporary iron-and-canvas vault known as **The Intake Pavilion**.  
**Visuals:** The air is thick with the smell of lamp oil, ozone, and the nervous sweat of 100,000 hopefuls. Above, worker-constructs crawl along the iron rafters, readying the fuel lines. The noise is a constant, vibrating thrum—the rhythmic *clank-clank-clank* of the city being assembled outside.

**The Filtering Mechanic: "The Spire Scan"**  
To progress toward the Academy gates, every student must first step into one of the hundreds of **Resonance Booths**.

- **The Process:** You aren't asked your name. You step into the booth, and a brass ring descends over you, humming with teal energy.
- **The "Rust" Result:** If a student's heart rate spikes too high, or their "Aura" flickers into grey-static, the booth emits a low, mournful foghorn blast.
  - *The Guard:* "Candidate 88,210. Standing: RUST. Access Denied. Return to the transport for City Maintenance reassignment."
  - *The Statistics:* ~22,419 candidates (20% of the intake) fail here. Their adventure ends at the very first gate.

**The Player Intake (The Receipt)**  
As the PCs pass their scans, they are directed to heavy iron desks with antiquated typewriters.

- **The Input:** They type their profiles. The machine stamps a **Loom Receipt**—their only proof of existence.
  - **Britt & Iggy:** Gold-Flecked Paper (100 pts). The printer hums a melody.
  - **Aggie & Ignatius:** Standard White Parchment (80 pts). The printer jitters.
  - **Loami:** Rough, Industrial-Grade Grey Paper (50 pts). The machine groans.

**The First View: The Dual-Spire Anchorage**  
As they enter the main campus:

- **The Twin Pillars:** The gilded **Sky-Spire** (Command/Elite Dorms) and the black-iron **Deep-Hull** (Logistics/Classrooms) flank the central university hall.
- **The Spire-Scape:** A chaotic forest of steam cranes hoisting prefab dorms into place. The city is being built in real-time around them.

**Scene 1: The Grand Assembly (The Indoctrination)**  
**Location:** The Oculus Auditorium (located within the Sky-Spire Core).  
**The "Lie":** Dean Isolde Vane steps to the podium in a crisp, high-collared white uniform.

**The Speech: "The New Horizon"**  
"Citizens. Candidates. Look around you. We are the inheritors of the Great Discovery. For eighty years, our maps have remained static. We have missed the thrill of the unknown. But that silence is over!  
We welcome the Ash-bloods, whose mastery of heat brings a new fire to our Core. We look with awe toward the Mizizi, whose Node holds death at bay.  
But listen closely: **These are but the first two steps into a vast and forgotten world.**  
The map is not empty, it is merely waiting. The math proves there are **Missing Variables** out there—Hidden Clans needed to close the circuit. You are the needle. You are the thread. Go forth and find what has been lost. Find the glory that awaits us all!"

**The Insight (DC 15):** The Dean’s performance is flawless, but her hand grips the podium so hard the brass creaks. While the speech is a masterpiece of inspiration, she glances nervously at the lights. The talk of "new energy" feels less like a choice and more like a desperate necessity.

**Scene 2: Logistics & Dorm Assignments (The "Meat Grinder")**  
**The Chaos:** Following the assembly, the "Sultan-Guard" Wardens use their vibration halberds to herd the 77,000 remaining students toward the **Modular District**. It is a stampede of brass trunks, shouting, and confusion. The Academy is a city in motion, and you are being slotted into its gears.

**The Assignment Interface**  
At the gate of each dormitory block, a **Loom Kiosk** (typewriter/printer combo) is bolted to the stone.

- **Mechanic:** Students slide their Loom Receipt into a slot. The machine clatters, stamps the parchment, and spits out a brass key-tag.
- **The Result:** The Loom assigns living quarters based on clannish resonance and nomenclature (Alphabetical). Squad pairing is deferred until after the first academic evaluation.

**The Dorms**

- **Britt & Aggie (Block 04-Root):** A high-humidity modular unit built into a terraced cliff. The walls are covered in moss-textured insulation, and it smells faintly of damp earth and ancient spores.
- **Iggy & Ignatius (Block 12-Basalt):** A low-humidity, high-thermal block. Because their names both start with "I," the Loom has bunked the Earthkin and the Ash-blood together. The room is hot, dry, and smells like a forge.
- **Loami (Block 99-Piston):** Located in the "Industrial Overflow" wing near the Walker-Core. It’s a loud, vibrating space made of bare iron, echoing with the rhythmic thrum of the city boilers.

**The Roommates (Block 99-Piston)**  
Since Loami is separated from the others, he finds himself bunking with two "Technical Track" NPCs:

- **"Ratchet":** A Copper-rank cynic who has a prosthetic brass hand. "Welcome to the boiler room, kid. Don't believe the Dean. This place isn't a school; it's a battery, and we're the acid." (Voice: Hard-boiled Noir. Rasping. Bond: His specialized toolset. Flaw: Chronic Cynicism.)
- **"Soot":** A wide-eyed Rust-leaning student who is terrified of being "culled." He treats Loami like an expert because Loami actually knows how a wrench works. (Voice: Stuttering, quiet. Bond: His textbook. Flaw: Near-crippling anxiety.)

**The Guide: Celia Vance**  
Celia acts as a floating "Compliance Proctor" for the high-variance wing. She appears in the doorways of the various blocks, checking logs.

- "Celia: "Candidates, the Loom has determined your current housing is optimal for stabilizing your base frequencies. Do not fraternize across blocks until the first bell. I've already filed three demerits for noise in Block 12. Try to be... quieter."

**Scene 3: The First Night Sandbox (The Glitch)**  
**The Event:** Midway through the night, the **Sky-Spire Lights Flicker**. A low, grinding groan echoes through the hull of the city. For 10 seconds, the "Safe-Flame" bonfires turn blue, then sputter. It is a "Brownout"—the first sign of the Minimum.

**Key Locations & Rival Hooks**

1. **The Common Areas (The Central Quad):**
  - **The Hook:** **Sarge (Squad 09)** barely flinches at the brownout. He is cleaning a rusted bayonet.
  - **Interaction:** He warns Ignatius: "See that flicker? That's leadership failing. Don't let your fire burn out like theirs, kid. I'm getting my squad through this so we don't end up like the last ones." (Theme: Anti-Incompetence).
  - **NPC Depth:**
    - **Backstory:** A former grunt who watched his entire crew die because an arrogant Exploranaut pushed too hard into a Shattered Node. He survived, but he refuses to let it happen again.
    - **Bond:** His current "Expendable" squad. He feels a crushing, quiet responsibility for their survival.
    - **Flaw:** Deep Distrust of Command. He struggles to follow orders from "Golden" officers who haven't bled.
    - **Motive:** To finally graduate and lead his own crew so he can stop idiots from getting good soldiers killed.
  - **Exam Insight (Q3 - Resonance):** Sarge's emphasis on *control* and avoiding burnout hints that forcing a "Standard Overwrite" (Option B) is safer, but understanding the fire itself (Option A) prevents the "Variance error" he fears. **(Unlock Answer: A - Sympathetic Dissonance)**
2. **Academy Welcome Events (The Great Hall):**
  - **The Hook:** **Lucky (Squad 09)** is using the blackout confusion to swipe extra rations.
  - **Interaction:** He bumps into Loami. "Easy there, big man. Power's spotty tonight. If you need a generator override for Block 99, I know a guy who knows a guy. For a price."
  - **NPC Depth:**
    - **Backstory:** A street urchin from the Anchorage outskirts who pickpocketed a dead candidate's Loom Receipt to get into the intake.
    - **Bond:** A younger sister living in the "Low-Bunks" whom he sends his extra rations to.
    - **Flaw:** Pathological Grifter. He cannot stop the "hustle," even when it’s counter-productive.
    - **Motive:** To "fake it 'til he makes it" into a comfortable administrative job where he doesn't have to bleed.
  - **Exam Insight (Q9 - Crisis):** Lucky's prioritization of "wrenches" (the crew/engine) over "waste" (food) is a direct clue. **(Unlock Answer: A - The Engine Gamble)**
3. **Private Clubs (The Gilded Balconies):**
  - **The Hook:** **Valerius Sterling (Squad 01)** laughs off the flicker. "Atmospherics, nothing more." Beside him, **Seraphina Vox** is using a crystal prism to "score" the resonance of students walking below.
  - **Interaction:** He spots Britt/Aggie. "I hope you 'Savant' types don't panic. The Academy is built on Order. Chaos doesn't keep the lights on."
  - **Valerius NPC Depth:**
    - **Backstory:** Scion of the Sterling family, groomed to lead the Venture. He has never actually touched dirt; his hands are magically calloused to look "rugged."
    - **Bond:** The Sterling family reputation—he carries it like a heavy, gilded shield.
    - **Flaw:** Narcissism. He cannot process the idea of someone being more "efficient" than him.
  - **Seraphina NPC Depth:**
    - **Backstory:** A musical prodigy who views the world as a symphony. She finds Harmony's industrial noises "physically painful."
    - **Bond:** Her "Harmonic Tuning" kit; she treats the delicate crystal forks like children.
    - **Flaw:** Aesthetic Elitism. She literally gets a migraine from "ugly" or "low-frequency" people.
  - **Exam Insight (Q8 - First Contact):** Valerius's obsession with "Order" and appearance is a negative example. If Britt/Aggie realize his arrogance makes him a target, tell them: "You realize projecting authority often just paints a target on your back." **(Unlock Answer: A - Vulnerability)**
4. **Clan Assistance & Integration (The Help Desk):**
  - **Activity:** A small, overworked booth. A Mizizi student named **Kojo** is trying to explain "Geometric Syntax" to a group of confused Earthkin.
  - **NPC Depth:**
    - **Backstory:** The first Mizizi student to ever score Gold on the entry exam, but he was demoted to Silver after "administrative errors" by the Vanes.
    - **Bond:** A tiny bioluminescent seed from his home village that he keeps in a glass vial around his neck.
    - **Flaw:** Social Paralysis. He freezes up when the city noise gets too loud.
    - **Motive:** To prove that Mizizi "Root-Logic" is more stable than Harmony's "Brass-Science."
  - **The Hook:** **Pudge (Squad 09)** is hovering near the back. He isn't there for the math; he’s realized the Mizizi bring "Life-Capsules" (concentrated nutrients) that Harmony doesn't track as food.
  - **Pudge NPC Depth:**
    - **Backstory:** Son of a farmer whose land was "stitched" into a industrial zone. He’s been hungry since he was six years old.
    - **Bond:** His mother’s copper cooking spoon, which he carries in his boot.
    - **Flaw:** Cowardice. He will betray almost anyone for a hot meal.
5. **The Great Library (The Forbidden Wing):**
  - **The Hook:** **Pyrrhus (Ash-blood)** is in the map room, tracing a line on a chart.
  - **Interaction:** If Ignatius checks the map, he sees Pyrrhus has circled a spot in the ocean labelled "**The Trench**." Pyrrhus whispers: "The heat isn't disappearing. It's draining... down."
  - **NPC Depth:**
    - **Backstory:** An ex-priest of the Emberkin who was banished for "Heresy" when he claimed the Ancestors were screaming for help.
    - **Bond:** The "Living Flame" he carries in a specialized lantern—he says it's his father's soul.
    - **Flaw:** Paranoia. He believes every Harmony official is trying to "snuff out" his light.
    - **Motive:** To find the source of the heat-drain and stop Vumbua from "choking" the world.
  - **Exam Insight (Q4 - Tuning):** Pyrrhus's focus on the *depth* and internal drainage is the key. Tell him: "You realize the surface vibration is just a symptom. The problem is deep inside." **(Unlock Answer: A - The Internal Core)**
6. **Sky-Spire Auditoriums (The Observation Deck):**
  - **The Hook:** **Cassius Thorne (Squad 01)** is lecturing subordinates on "Bombardment Zones."
  - **Interaction:** He eyes Iggy. "You Earthkin... you're dense. Good. When the drop-pods hit the crust, I'll need someone heavy to soak up the impact. Try not to crumble."
  - **NPC Depth:**
    - **Backstory:** His grandfather was the General who "suppressed" the Ash-blood Uprising 30 years ago. He wants to finish the job.
    - **Bond:** The Thorne Legion code—a black iron signet ring he never takes off.
    - **Flaw:** Bloodlust. He views every interaction as a tactical encounter to be won or lost.
7. **Deep-Hull Decks (The Betting Ring)/(The Vents):**
  - **The Hook:** Older students aren't just betting on survival; they are betting on **The Draft**.
  - **Interaction:** Loami hears: "10-to-1 Captain Scorch takes the Ash-blood kid. He loves the fire-types. But **Professor Ink**? He's looking for weirdos. Put 5 chits on him taking the Earthkin." (Seeding the Captains).
8. **The Cliffside (Iggy’s Moment):**
  - **The Hook:** During the brownout, **Iggy** feels a sudden, sharp tremor in the earth—not a machine vibration, but a *geological* signal. It feels like a heartbeat from deep below the crust.
  - **The Risk:** His "Trench-Kin" physiology reacts involuntarily—his goggles fog up with pressurized steam. He has to hide it before a passing Warden notices he isn't human.
  - **Exam Insight (Q6 - Density):** The tremor teaches Iggy that stability comes from internal pressure, not external bracing. **(Unlock Answer: A - Internal Pressure)**

**Scene 4: The Speed-Run (Week 1 Montage)**

- **Monday:** "Cartography." (Blind Navigator). *Draw what you see, not what you expect.*
- **Tuesday:** "Harmonic Ethics." (Guest: **Overseer Grimaldi**). *Growth is mandatory.*
- **Wednesday:** "Anchor Maintenance." (Loami shines).
- **Thursday:** "Xenobiology." (Guest: **Architect Stone**). *Structure over Nature.*
- **Friday:** "The Calculus of Sacrifice." *When to cut the line.*

**Scene 5: The First Exam (The Gauntlet)**  
**Location:** The Intake Hangar (Converted to Exam Hall).  
**Mechanic:** Hand out the `Venture_Exam_Survey.md`.  
**The Stakes:**

- **150+ Pts:** Gold Rank (Elite Captains).
- **100-149 Pts:** Silver Rank.
- **60-99 Pts:** Copper Rank.
- **< 60 Pts:** Rust (Game Over/Reassignment).

**Scene 6: The Reveal (Captain Selection)**  
**The Climax:**

1. The Loom processes the scores.
2. **Squad 7-Alpha** is officially formed (The PCs are grouped).
3. **The Handout:** Give them the **Vumbua Captains Manifest**.
4. **The Choice:** They must agree on ONE Captain to interview with.

## Lore & Physics Master Document

**Version:** 9.0 (The Evaporation & Surge Update)  
**Focus:** The Missing Surge, Evaporation, and The Scientist's Terror

### I. The Physics of Harmony: Resonance & Integrity

**Energy is a bond. The crisis is that the bond is breaking.**

**1. The Mechanic: The Resonant Anchor**

- **The Concept:** A "Battery" (Resonator) stores a Sympathetic Connection to the Land.
- **The "Charge":** This is a measure of Bond Integrity.
  - **100% Charge:** The crystal is singing in perfect harmony with the Global Amplitude.
  - **0% Charge:** The crystal has gone "Grey." It has lost the hum.
- **Harmony Science:** Harmony scientists think power runs out after 3 days. Reality: The umbra crystals lose their connection to Harmony.
- **The Evaporation (The Threat):** "Evaporation" is the gradual taper of the Global Amplitude average. It has always slowly increased, but over the last 80 years it stalled & began to decrease This is a huge threat.

**2. The Great Hope: "The Surge"**

- **The Theory:** Integrating a new Clan (Node) creates a massive spike in Global Amplitude.
- **The History:** When the "Fire-Stitch" happened 150 years ago, the Surge was so powerful it melted the old grid (The Night of Sparks).
- **The Prediction:** The Ash-Blood Integration (24 months ago) was calculated to produce a Class-5 Surge, filling the global reserves and stopping the Evaporation for centuries. In reality, it barely hit the average as a statistical impact and the Global Amplitude is still below its all-time high.

### II. The Real Crisis: The Flatline

**Why Professor Kante is terrified.**  
**1. The Data: The Surge That Never Came**

- **Expected Result:** Ash-Blood Integration -> Amplitude rises to 750+.
- **Actual Result:** Amplitude rose to 565 (barely above the Minimum) and stopped.
- **The Implication:** We plugged in a massive source, but the car didn't speed up.

**2. The Acceleration: Evaporation**

- **Status:** Since the integration, the "Evaporation Rate" has *increased*.
- **The Scientist's Fallacy:** Kante thinks the Ash-Bloods are "duds" (low energy) or that the crystals are defective.
- **The GM Truth (Shattered Circuit):** The Ash-Bloods are powerful, but the Circuit is Grounded. The energy from the new Node *isn't filling the system*; it is bleeding out through the "missing limbs" of the other clans. The system is hemorrhaging power faster than the Ash-Bloods can generate it.
- ***In reality once all clans are integrated there will be a 2000 surge which will blow past the grids of the current gen batteries...***

### III. History of Tech: The Evolution of Stability

**Era 1: The Gilded Volatility (200 Years Ago)**

- **Tech:** Aether-Vanes.
- **Reality:** High Amplitude, High Risk. The world was awash in power, but it was inconsistent. Power fluctuated up and down daily.

**Era 2: The Vox Stabilization (150 Years Ago)**

- **Tech:** Umbra-Quartz Batteries.
- **Reality:** Stable, portable power. Vox promised "Eternal Consistency."

### IV. Professor Kante’s Struggle

**1. The "Partial Stitch" Paradox**

- **The Reality:** The clans were once a single "Shattered Circuit."
- **The Effect:** Integrating just the Ash-Bloods (Power) created a Grounding Fault.
- **The Result:** The Amplitude stabilized at 565, but the drag is increasing.

**2. The Endgame: "The Great Surge"**

- **The Trigger:** When ALL SIX clans are integrated.
- **The Consequence:** Amplitude spikes to 2,000+.
- **The Catastrophe:** Vox "Void-Lock" crystals will shatter under that pressure. The world needs the old Gilded "Flow" tech combined with Trench-Kin grounding to survive it.
