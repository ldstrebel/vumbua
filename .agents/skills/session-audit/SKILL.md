## 🚫 Comprehensive Failure Modes & Post-Mortem Register

### 1. Gist-Level Manifest Truncation
* **Symptom:** High-value character dialogue, comedic beats, or world-tech explanations present in raw audio vanish from the novelization.
* **Root Cause:** Compressing raw transcript turns into summary bullets. Downstream prose generators never see the skipped turns.
* **Prevention:** Every spoken turn must be tracked in the manifest ledger and accounted for in prose.

### 2. Heuristic Keyword Coarseness
* **Symptom:** Audit tools report `[PASS]` even though critical spoken exchanges are completely missing.
* **Root Cause:** Checking binary keyword presence rather than verbatim line-by-line dialogue representation.
* **Prevention:** Never rely on regex matchers alone. Conduct granular scene-by-scene dialogue audits.

### 3. Fused Interjections & Turn Order Compression
* **Symptom:** Rapid speaker alternation gets collapsed into a single speaker's continuous monologue, dropping interjections.
* **Root Cause:** Skipping interjections as "table chatter".
* **Prevention:** Read multi-speaker clusters holistically. Every interjection must have its own prose beat.

### 4. OOC Table Talk vs. In-World Character Banter Misclassification
* **Symptom:** Real in-world banter stripped as table talk, or OOC meta questions novelized into in-universe canon.
* **Prevention:** Config-gated attribution with explicit `ooc_ranges` and `ooc_lines` declaring table talk with real names.

### 5. STT Phonetic Mishearings & Entity Name Drift
* **Symptom:** Names mangled (`Rill` $\rightarrow$ `Real`, `Professor Ink` $\rightarrow$ `Professor Inc.`, `Aggie` $\rightarrow$ `Nagy`, `Bramble` $\rightarrow$ `Vanball`, `Pip` $\rightarrow$ `Kim`).
* **Prevention:** Cross-reference every entity against `characters/` and `lore/` dossiers before writing scene blocks.

### 6. Clipped STT Lines Rendered as Stylistic Ellipsis
* **Symptom:** Incomplete STT lines rendered as intentional trailing-off rather than resolving the full sentence.
* **Prevention:** Flag all syntactically incomplete lines with `[CLIPPED]` and reconstruct intent from surrounding context.

### 7. Tier B Player Narration Rendered as Tier A In-World Dialogue
* **Symptom:** Player talking about their character in third person (*"Britt is just zoned"*) gets quoted as in-world speech.
* **Prevention:** Convert Tier B third-person player intent into vivid narrator prose and character action.

### 8. The "Dialogue-Dense Scene" Compression Trap
* **Symptom:** Scenes with 3+ simultaneous speakers compressed to a single-voice monologue.
* **Prevention:** In multi-speaker scenes (e.g. lab debates, bridge banter), write every speaker interjection as a separate paragraph with its own action beat.

### 9. Vision POV Inversion (First-Person vs. Second-Hand Outsider)
* **Symptom:** Ancestral visions written as immersive first-person possession rather than secondhand memories viewed through ancient eyes.
* **Prevention:** Frame visions through the Spirit Tortoise's memory: characters are witnesses watching secondhand history, not possessors.

### 10. Embedded / Italicized Summary Dialogue Anti-Pattern
* **Symptom:** Spoken dialogue is stripped of quotation marks and buried into running narrative sentences with em-dashes and italics (e.g., `*No, dude, they like me way more than you,* Pip said...`).
* **Root Cause:** Attempting to summarize conversational pacing rather than dramatizing the scene.
* **Prevention:** **STRICT BAN ON EMBEDDED ITALIC DIALOGUE.** All spoken character lines MUST be formatted as standard quoted dialogue (`"..."`) with proper paragraph breaks, dialogue tags, and physical beats.

### 11. Truncated Comedic Timing & Lost Character Dynamics
* **Symptom:** Comedic setups, escalations, punchlines, and physical slapstick (e.g., Pip realizing she volunteered, demanding the vial, slamming her forehead into the tree) are flattened into a single passive sentence.
* **Root Cause:** Treating comedic exchanges as "minor filler" rather than essential characterization.
* **Prevention:** Comedic beats must receive full scene staging: **Setup $\rightarrow$ Escalation $\rightarrow$ Punchline $\rightarrow$ Reaction**.

### 12. Player Game-State Clarification Rendered as In-World Character Dialogue
* **Symptom:** A player asking the GM an environmental or game-state question (*"Is the turtle still walking ahead of us?"*, *"Is the door open?"*, *"Can I see the bridge?"*) is rendered literally as spoken in-universe character dialogue.
* **Root Cause:** Treating all speech on a player's microphone as in-character speech without recognizing game-state clarification queries.
* **Prevention:** Translate player environment/state questions into sensory prose observations and character focus, not spoken dialogue by a character looking right at the object.

### 13. Anachronistic Naming & Harmony Name Collisions in Ancestral Visions
* **Symptom:** Using proper character names in narrative descriptions during secondhand memory sequences when the watching characters have never met or heard these ancient figures, or using names that overlap with modern Harmony characters (e.g. `Vox`).
* **Root Cause:** Treating storyboard shorthand as in-universe omniscient labels.
* **Prevention:** Use pure physical/clan descriptors for all ancient figures in narrative prose (*the root-kin elder*, *the smoldering ember chieftain*, *the sky-weaver*, *the Empress of the Golden Age*). Only use spoken names if they are declared in-universe, and ensure they are uniquely clan-driven with zero modern Harmony collisions.

### 14. Dialogue Paraphrase & Summary Compression (The "Told, Not Shown" Trap)
* **Symptom:** Key verbal exchanges (e.g. Lomi bantering with the goblin driver, Aggie comforting Val, Ignatius flirting with Zephyr) are summarized into a narrator sentence rather than written out as active dialogue.
* **Root Cause:** Prioritizing word economy over character voice and emotional immersion.
* **Prevention:** If characters speak in the raw audio, write out the verbatim dialogue lines with emotional cadence and micro-actions.

### 15. Broken Sequential Cause-and-Effect Bridges
* **Symptom:** An action or line happens without the prerequisite trigger (e.g., Pip yelling about not dying before Aggie explains that they have to come with the turtle).
* **Root Cause:** Dropping connective lines between speakers during scene drafting.
* **Prevention:** Trace every conversation as an unbroken causal chain: **Trigger $\rightarrow$ Reaction $\rightarrow$ Resolution**.

### 16. Dropped World-Media & Atmospheric Broadcasts
* **Symptom:** Radio broadcasts, speaker horns, public speeches, and ambient environmental lore (e.g., Valerius Sterling's radio dispatches, naval cannon salutes, background clinic triage announcements) are omitted.
* **Prevention:** Always scan raw audio and session planning materials for in-universe media broadcasts and integrate them into the physical scene environment.

### 17. Omission of Post-Session Thematic Reflections
* **Symptom:** Profound out-of-character GM/player discussions regarding core campaign themes (e.g. Sparks vs. Nodes, Exponential Connection, Stagnation as Death, Unending Horizons of Exploration) are discarded as mere "table talk."
* **Prevention:** Channel deep OOC thematic insights into rich, philosophical narrative prose and character epiphanies during chapter resolutions.

## ✍️ The Ebook Standard: Mandatory Novelization Checklist

Every generated scene block (`clean/blocks/sN-scene-XX.md`) and compiled story chapter must satisfy this 6-point standard before being marked complete:

1. **Full Dialogue Dramatization**:
   - All spoken lines formatted with double quotes (`"..."`).
   - Every speaker change gets a dedicated paragraph.
   - Zero embedded italic dialogue summaries.

2. **Sensory & Physical Anchoring**:
   - Include distinct physical mannerisms: Iggy's water goggles sloshing, Lomi adjusting his woolen flat cap, Ignatius's cuffs flaring embers, Britt's intense botanical gaze, Ink furiously scribbling in her logbook.

3. **Complete Comedic & Emotional Arcs**:
   - Multi-speaker banter preserved with full setup, timing, escalation, and reactions intact.

4. **Deep World-Building & Mechanical Magic**:
   - Fully describe world-tech and elemental physics (Embodied Energy, acoustic resonance, living keratin maps, copper conductors, pneumatic walkers).

5. **Logical Causal Continuity**:
   - Every character action and reaction must have an explicit in-world trigger.

6. **Line Traceability & Ledger Parity**:
   - Every scene must contain line anchors (`<!-- Lxxxx -->`) mapping back to `sN-raw-indexed.md` and a clean ledger comment at the bottom.

## 🧭 Pre-Story Narrative Weaving & Flow Audit Protocol (The Author Agent Gate)

**MANDATORY GATE:** Before an author agent ever moves into clean story writing, scene drafting, or book assembly, it MUST execute and document a **Pre-Story Narrative Weaving & Flow Audit**.

This audit guarantees that the narrative reads like a masterwork Sanderson novel rather than a series of disjointed session transcripts.

* **Master Storyboard Reference**: The author agent must load and cross-reference [`campaign/prep/book-1-narrative-structure.md`](file:///d:/Code/vumbua/campaign/prep/book-1-narrative-structure.md) for Volume 1's 5-Act structure, chapter-by-chapter beat sheets, character reflection triggers, and global plot lines before writing.

### 1. The Long-Horizon Trajectory Audit (Destination Awareness)
* **Rule:** An author agent cannot write the opening of a saga without deeply understanding its climax.
* **Audit Step:** Review the destination of the current campaign arc (e.g. Session 12's climax: the Six Sparks/Nodes, the lie of clan isolation, Mwaza-Kasa's living shell, Lomi's starship vision, and Iggy's ocean trench roots).
* **Application:** Verify that early-session worldbuilding and dialogue plant subtle, unforced foreshadowing seeds for these ultimate revelations without committing to speculative false canon or spoiling the mystery.

### 2. The Anti-Frontloading Pacing Rule (The Prologue Pacing Gate)
* **Rule:** Never bury the reader under a massive, static worldbuilding prologue (e.g. 6,000+ words of clan histories) before introducing characters taking active agency in the present.
* **The Two-Tier Architecture:**
  1. **The Streamlined Prologue (~1,000–1,500 words):** Restricted strictly to the essential high-concept setup the reader needs before Chapter 1 begins (the stagnant world, 80 years of static maps, the mystery of the stalled rot, the arrival of the Paper Man, and the call to the Academy).
  2. **Character Origin Beats as Woven Reflections:** The deep clan worldbuilding, creation dialogue, and personal histories are extracted from the prologue and woven directly into the main story chapters as **character reflection beats and flashbacks**.

### 3. The 4-Part Narrative Weaving Matrix
Before drafting or structuring chapters, the author agent must explicitly map each character through the **Narrative Weaving Matrix**:
* **A. Present Action Trigger:** What active, physical event is the character experiencing right now in the present timeline? (e.g. Britt smashing the typewriter desk; Iggy tearing down the gantry; Ignatius on fire in the harbor; Lomi inspecting the cranes).
* **B. Sensory / Emotional Cue:** What specific sensory trigger or emotional pause sparks the flashback? (e.g. escaping the proctor into the crowd; looking up at open sky for the first time; watching a noble scrub soot from his palm).
* **C. Origin Beat Revealed:** What essential piece of clan lore, relationship dynamic, or character philosophy from Session 0 is dramatized? (e.g. the Mizizi's sacred decay belief; the subterranean pressure and fear of the void; the Ash-Blood's pride in primal "hot rocks"; the boilermaker's explorer knots).
* **D. Long-Term Climax Seed:** What subtle clue or philosophical contrast is planted for the campaign climax? (e.g. Iggy asking if boats go underwater; Lomi diagnosing the mechanical heart; Ignatius valuing cooperation over cold intellect).

### 4. Monotonic Novel Chapter Progression (Continuous Chapter Counting)
* **Rule:** Sessions are tabletop scheduling boundaries; Chapters are novel milestones. **Never reset chapter numbers to "Chapter 1" at the start of a new session.**
* **Structure:** Count chapters monotonically upward across the entire novel/volume (`CHAPTER 1` through `CHAPTER N`). 
* **Convention:**
  - `PROLOGUE: [Title]` (Streamlined world setup)
  - `CHAPTER 1` begins with the first active narrative beat of Session 1.
  - Alternating present-day chapters and reflection chapters count upward continuously across all subsequent sessions (e.g., Session 11 and 12 carry forward their continuous numbers rather than resetting).
