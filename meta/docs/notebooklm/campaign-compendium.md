## World Overview

### The Setting

**Vumbua** is a Magitek-Steampunk campaign set in a world being literally stitched together through thaumaturgical engineering. The world isn't expanding through conquest—it's being **assembled** through a process called **The Great Stitching**, where isolated civilizations and their reality-Nodes are integrated into a growing empire called **Harmony**.

> *"We do not conquer land; we wake it up."*

### The Central Mystery

For 80 years, no new Nodes were discovered. The "Ocean of Aether" between realities became impassable, and Harmony began to stagnate. Then, 24 months ago, the **Ash-Blood Isles** were discovered, and suddenly new frontiers opened. **Vumbua Academy**, a mobile city-state, has relocated to this new frontier for the first time in generations—and 100,000 candidates have arrived for the largest intake class in history.

### The Great Stitching

The Great Stitching is the physical process of integrating separate pocket realities into a contiguous world. Each isolated civilization exists within a **Node**—a concentration of reality tied to a specific physics or concept (Heat, Growth, Memory, etc.).

When isolated, Nodes are weak and slowly fade. When properly integrated through two-way energy flow, they amplify each other and create stable "Safe Lanes" through the chaotic Aether.

### Campaign Themes

- **Expansion vs. Exploitation**: Is Harmony saving dying civilizations or strip-mining them?
- **Knowledge vs. Ignorance**: What happens when you destroy history to survive?
- **Integration vs. Identity**: Can cultures merge without losing who they are?
- **Stagnation vs. Progress**: Is growth always good? Is decay always bad?

## Core Mechanics

### Nodes

A **Node** is a pocket of concentrated reality/power representing specific physics or concepts:
- **Ash-Bloods**: Heat/Power
- **Mizizi**: Memory/Archive
- **Trench-Kin**: Resources/Depth (uncontacted)
- **Renali**: Vision/Sky (uncontacted)
- **Wadi**: Life/Water (weak Node)
- **Harmony**: Direction/Structure

When isolated, Nodes are weak and slowly fade. When integrated, they amplify each other exponentially.

### Integration

Integration is the process of connecting a new Node to Harmony. It requires **two-way energy flow**:

**Inward Flow** (Raw materials from new Node power Harmony tech):
- Must be at 100% efficiency
- Example: Ash-Blood obsidian in boilers

**Outward Flow** (Harmony batteries power local functions in new territory):
- Proves Harmony sustains the new land
- Example: Cooling suits for Ash-Bloods

**Integration Benefits:**
- Creates Safe Lanes (calm corridors through Aether storms)
- Amplifies both the new Node and existing Harmony territories
- Prevents "The Bleed" (dissolution at reality edges)

**Current Integration Status:**
- Ash-Bloods: 100% (successful, 24 months)
- Mizizi: 15% (stalled, 4 months)
- Others: Uncontacted or unreached

### The Aether

The chaotic space between integrated realities. Filled with:
- Dangerous beasts (Void-Beasts, Ether-Jellies)
- Unstable physics
- Reality distortions

Becomes calm "Safe Lanes" after successful integration.

### Crystal Batteries

Harmony's primary energy storage technology:
- Glowing blue/teal crystals
- Link to central power network
- Power everything from industrial boilers to personal devices
- Currently running lean (secret)

### The Loom

Massive crystal computer in the Walker-Core that:
- Calculates probabilities
- Assigns student ranks
- Flags "Savant" outliers based on variance
- Can predict integration success rates

### Ranks at Vumbua Academy

Students are ranked by The Loom:

| Rank | % of Students | Status |
|------|---------------|--------|
| **Gold** (Aurum) | 1% | Aristocracy, cannot be demoted to Rust |
| **Silver** (Argent) | 24% | Professional workforce |
| **Copper** (Aes) | 55% | Laborers and general workforce |
| **Rust** (Ferrum) | 20% | Stripped of receipts, assigned maintenance or trap detection |

**Savant System**: High-variance outliers flagged by The Loom. Can lead to promotion (Gold) or expulsion (Heretic). Risk/reward for unusual problem-solving.

## Locations

### Vumbua Academy (The Safiri)

A mobile city-state that teleports to frontiers. Currently stationed at the Ash-Blood Isles (6 months).

**The Three Cores:**

1. **Sky-Spire** (Golden airship component)
   - Houses Command, Elite Dorms, Navigation
   - Where Dean Vane has her chaotic office
   - Can detach and fly independently

2. **Walker-Core** (Four-legged industrial mech)
   - Houses Engineering, Power systems, The Loom
   - Can transport other Cores slowly over land
   - Iron-Union territory

3. **Deep-Hull** (Submersible/underground component)
   - Storage, Archives, Secure Research
   - Can dive or burrow for safety

**The Spire-Scape:**
- 70% of Vumbua's current structures
- Scaffolding, prefab dorms, rapid construction
- Built by Worker-Constructs upon landing
- Temporary until class size is manageable (~20,000)

**Population:**
- 70,000 students (after first-day culling from 100,000)
- Mix of Harmony citizens, integrated species, constructs
- Only a few hundred clan members total

**The Blocks:**
- **Blocks 1-30**: Academic spires, libraries (pale blue crystal-light)
- **Blocks 30-80**: Residential sectors, tens of thousands of windows
- **Blocks 80-100**: Industrial districts, furnaces (orange glow)

### Harmony Prime

The static capital city far from the frontier:
- Seat of the Domestic Council
- Where Lady Ignis serves on High Council
- Exemplifies "old Harmony" - ornate, established, comfortable
- Connected via Safe Lanes but weeks of travel

### The Ash-Blood Isles

Chain of volcanic mountains with perpetual smoke and magma flows:
- Recently integrated (24 months ago)
- Volcanoes "roared back to life" during integration
- Primary export: Obsidian that burns hotter than coal
- Homeland of the Ash-Blood clan
- Current location of Vumbua Academy

### The Mizizi Petrified Forest

Massive fossilized mega-flora serving as hollow dwellings:
- Stone-wood refuses to decay properly
- Integration stalled at 15%
- Being systematically destroyed by clan with Harmony's help
- Location: Unknown to most (Exchange Ritual secrecy)

> [!CAUTION]
> **GM ONLY**: The forest is actually a biological data archive containing 10,000 years of Imperial history. The Mizizi are unwittingly deleting their own heritage.

### The Frontier

The newly accessible territories beyond the Safe Lanes:
- Uncharted, dangerous, full of opportunity
- Where Exploranauts are being trained to explore
- Contains undiscovered Nodes and civilizations
- Protected from casual entry by Aether storms

---

## Factions & Clans

### Harmony (The Direction)

Harmony is not a single bloodline but a coalition of **Great Houses** and **Guilds** that define themselves by Expansion, Technology, and Law.

**Philosophy:** "Expansion is life. Stagnation is death."

#### The Great Houses

**House Vane (The Shield)**
- **Domain**: Defense, Walls, Military Strategy
- **Philosophy**: "Safety through Separation"
- **Key Members**:
  - Lord Commander Titus Vane: Military leader, aggressive expansionist
  - Dean Isolde Vane: Head of Vumbua Academy, Titus's sister, believes in understanding over conquest

**House Vox (The Spark)**
- **Domain**: Energy, Fuel, Crystal Batteries
- **Philosophy**: "Power is Life"
- **Key Members**:
  - Arch-Duke Cymon Vox: Ruthless patriarch controlling battery supply
  - Seraphina "Serra" Vox: His runaway daughter, hiding at Academy

**House Sterling (The Sail)**
- **Domain**: Trade, Logistics, Fleet Command
- **Philosophy**: "Movement is Wealth"
- **Key Members**:
  - Captain Elara Thorne-Sterling: Famous explorer, discovered Ash-Blood Isles
  - Valerius Sterling: Head of Merchant Fleet

**House Gilded (The Vault)**
- **Domain**: Treasury, Banking, Resource Allocation
- **Philosophy**: "Everything has a Price"
- Often in conflict with House Vox over resource pricing

#### The Guilds

**The Iron-Union** (Most Powerful Guild)
- **Domain**: Engines, Boilers, Construction
- **Members**: Engineers, Mechanics, Laborers
- **Tension**: Feel they keep the city running while Houses take credit

**Scrivener Guild**
- **Domain**: Knowledge, Maps, Documentation
- Historical role in decoding integration mechanics

**The Verdant Trust**
- **Domain**: Agriculture, Food Production
- Less relevant on the frontier

---

### The Clans

#### Ash-Bloods (The Ember-Kin, Pyre-Keepers)

*Volcanic forge-keepers with hearts of fire*

**Appearance:** Humanoid-elemental hybrids with obsidian skin (dark, glassy flesh that glows with inner heat). Leave trails of soot and ash. Some literally smolder with flame.

**Philosophy:** "Fire is Ancestor" - Fire is not a tool but a living ancestor that must be respected and fed.

**Integration Status:** 100% successful (24 months ago)

**What Integration Brought:**
- **To Harmony:** Raw obsidian, volcanic heat for forges, geothermal power, Safe Lane
- **To Ash-Bloods:** Cooling Suits, access to Harmony tech, **volcanoes roared back to life**

**Cultural Notes:**
- Clean themselves regularly (soot is from travel, not culture)
- True Flame (orange, oxygen-consuming) is sacred
- Safe-Flame (teal, chemically stable) is "fake fire" and shameful
- Physical contact doesn't burn others despite appearances

**The Resurgence:** Since integration, Ash-Blood youth experience miraculous brightening of skin instead of fading. Proximity to other active Nodes amplifies their heat.

**Generational Divide:**
- **Elders:** Remember "The Cold Times," fear outsiders drain warmth
- **Youth:** Feel surge of power, want to rush toward city center

**The Boiler Room:** Ash-Bloods beg for boiler shifts—only place hot enough to feel like home. Vumbua retrofitted port engine for Direct Obsidian Transfer (300% more efficient).

**Known Ash-Bloods:**
- Ignatius (PC) - On pilgrimage to find new heat
- Lady Ignis - Representative on Harmony's High Council (Harmony Prime)
- Kindle - Student desperately trying to fit in with Legacy Kids

**Shattered Circuit Role:** **POWER** (The Engines)

> [!CAUTION]
> **GM ONLY**: 18 months ago, Ash-Bloods insulted Trench-Kin by dropping an Obsidian Tablet instead of sending Exchange bride. Tablet read: "The Heat has returned. We need nothing from the Dark." This triggered Iggy's infiltration to the surface.

> [!CAUTION]
> **GM ONLY**: Ash-Blood heat is a Resonance Chamber that amplifies when near other Nodes. Integration itself is the "new heat" Ignatius seeks—he just doesn't realize it yet.

---

#### Mizizi (Root-Kin, Deep-Root Clan, Mycelium Clan)

*Fungal-turtle clan of the Petrified Forest*

**Appearance:** Fusion of turtle and fungus—turtle-shaped bodies with shells resembling mushroom caps, skin with dusty spore-like texture.

**Philosophy:** "When things stop dying, we start dying" - Literal, not metaphorical. Stagnation and refusal to decay are existential horrors.

**Integration Status:** 15% (stalled, 4 months)

**Current Situation:** The Petrified Forest has "failed"—things won't decay properly, new growth appears instantly when pruned. Elders believe ancient prophecy is coming true: "When the world comes, things stop dying."

**The Pact with Harmony:**
- **Harmony provides:** Industrial solvents, mechanical shredders, transportation
- **Harmony takes:** Soil samples, bark/root material, petrified stone
- **Mizizi see this as:** Chance to restart stalled cycle of death

**Cultural Notes:**
- Work in pairs for "Tethering" - never connect to Great Mother Forest alone
- One "Travels the Roots," one "Anchors"
- Prolonged connection causes "Strange Visions"
- Large enough clan that not everyone knows everyone

**Known Mizizi Members:**
- Over 100 clan members, but not everyone knows everyone
- Britt (PC) - Gray, dusty fungal-turtle. Outspoken, suspicious of Harmony
- Aggie (PC) - Red-and-white spotted mushroom-turtle. Cautious cousin of Britt
- Rill (NPC) - Mysterious researcher who left the forest 2 years ago. Publicly viewed as "traitor"

**Shattered Circuit Role:** **MEMORY** (The Archivists)

> [!CAUTION]
> **GM ONLY - THE TERRIBLE TRUTH**: The Petrified Forest is a living data archive—biological hard drives storing 10,000 years of Imperial history. The "non-decaying growth" is the Library's defense mechanism trying to survive. The Mizizi tradition of pruning Oldest to Youngest means they're systematically deleting Golden Age records first, leaving only tales of collapse and horror. The "Strange Visions" are data-dumps of stored memories.

> [!CAUTION]
> **GM ONLY - INTEGRATION FAILURE**: The Mizizi Node is MEMORY, not Biology. Integration requires: (1) Inward Flow: Turn Mizizi Bark into paper filled with knowledge near an Integrated Core; (2) Outward Flow: Cart Stored Knowledge (Books/Archives) into the forest. The forest doesn't eat fertilizer—it eats *history*.

---

#### Trench-Kin (Earthkin, Abyssal)

*Deep-earth/ocean dwelling clan*

**Status:** Completely uncontacted by Harmony (officially)

**Physiology:** High-pressure adapted, deep-earth/ocean dwellers

**Integration Status:** 0% (unknown/unreached)

**Known Trench-Kin:**
- Iggy (PC) - **Secret infiltrator** posing as generic "Earthkin"

**Shattered Circuit Role:** **RESOURCES** (The Miners)

> [!CAUTION]
> **GM ONLY**: Iggy is Trench-Kin who found the insulting Obsidian Tablet from Ash-Bloods. Elders buried it to prevent curiosity, but Iggy read it as an invitation to the surface. He's investigating why Ash-Bloods stopped coming to Exchange rituals.

---

#### Renali (Air Clan, Cloud-Kin, Storm-Kin)

*Sky-dwelling clan riding Air-Bees*

**Status:** Not yet contacted by Harmony (scouts only)

**Integration Status:** 0% (unreached)

**Known Renali:**
- Zephyr - Exchange member who arrived 18 months ago among Mizizi
- Unlike disciplined envoys, openly breaks the Taboo
- Works with Dean Vane on wind-pattern research

**Shattered Circuit Role:** **VISION** (The Architects)

---

#### Wadi (River Clan, Dry Vein)

*Desert canyon dwellers controlling weak Water Node*

**Status:** Known but not formally integrated

**Homeland:** Desert canyons, lost bond with Air Clan during Old Empire collapse

**Technology:** Still-Suits reclaim moisture

**Integration Status:** Unknown (Node is very weak)

**Known Wadi:**
- Rill - **Secret identity**, officially presented as Mizizi

**Shattered Circuit Role:** **LIFE** (The Sustainers)

> [!CAUTION]
> **GM ONLY**: Rill is actually Wadi who entered Mizizi Forest as exchange member 6 years ago. She suspects the forest shouldn't be destroyed and is researching alternatives.

---

### The Exchange Ritual

Inter-clan genetic diversity system occurring every 5 years at neutral "Hollow Point":
- Members blindfolded to prevent mapping
- **The Taboo:** Never speak of your home again after exchange
- Last ritual: 18 months ago (when Zephyr arrived, Ash-Bloods broke it)

This system maintained clan diversity during 10,000 years of separation.

---

## Bestiary

### Ether-Jelly

---

### Void-Beast

**Type:** Smoke predators

**Hunting Method:** Hunt fear, not heat

**Weaknesses:**
- Cannot cross circle of True Flame (orange, oxygen-consuming)
- Harmony's floodlights DON'T work
- Safe-Flame is ineffective

**Threat Level:** High in Aether, dangerous near Safe Lane edges

**Tactics:** Stalks groups, isolates fearful individuals

---

### Rot-Shepherd

**Type:** Forest guardians

**Status:** Rarely encountered, poorly documented

**Nature:** Unknown—possibly Mizizi-related entities

**Threat Level:** Unknown

## GM-Only Secrets

> [!CAUTION]
> **The following section contains information NOT known to player characters**

### The Minimum Crisis

**The Truth:** Harmony is approaching a critical power threshold below which essential tech fails. When crossed, lights and medical devices lose charge.

**Who Knows:** Council, Dean Isolde, a few engineers who can "feel" the Ghost Charge

**Taboo:** Discussing power levels is forbidden even among those who suspect

**Reality:** Without the Ash-Blood integration, Harmony would already be dark. Each clan integration buys 1-2 years of power at most.

### The Shattered Circuit Theory

The six clans were once one ancient Empire that fell 10,000 years ago. They are specialized castes, not separate species:

- **Mizizi** (Memory) - The Archivists
- **Ash-Bloods** (Power) - The Engines
- **Trench-Kin** (Resources) - The Miners
- **Renali** (Vision) - The Architects
- **Wadi** (Life) - The Sustainers
- **Harmony** (Direction) - The Navigators

**Key Insight:** Ash-Blood and Mizizi Nodes leak power to missing siblings. Must integrate ALL SIX to stop the bleed and achieve a 500-year Golden Age.

**Who Knows:** Dean Isolde, Senior Historian Nadine, possibly Rill, fragments in Mizizi archives

**Players Know:** NONE of this

### Character Secrets

**Iggy:** Actually Trench-Kin infiltrator who found the insulting Obsidian Tablet. Came to surface to learn why Ash-Bloods "need nothing from the Dark."

**Serra:** Seraphina Vox, runaway daughter of Arch-Duke Cymon Vox (House Vox patriarch). Hiding noble identity to learn about clans authentically.

**Rill:** Actually Wadi (River Clan), not Mizizi. Entered forest as exchange member 6 years ago. Researching if forest destruction is necessary.

**Ignatius:** Genuinely believes he's seeking "new heat" for his clan. Doesn't realize integration itself IS the answer—his clan doesn't need external fire; they need to be part of a larger network.
