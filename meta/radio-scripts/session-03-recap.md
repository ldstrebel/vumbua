[excited] "Good evening, Vumbua! Or should I say... good morning? The sun is threatening to rise over the upper tiers, but the city that never stops humming is still WIDE awake! I'm Valerius Sterling, your voice in the steam, broadcasting LIVE!"

"What a night it's been down at the Celestial Lounge! The amber lights, the clinking glasses... rumors say that certain members of House Gilded were out pushing their luck at Crown and Ruin. Though, word on the street is a certain relative of mine got bested by a Copper-rank! Oh, the SCANDALS of high society! I'm sure my father is thrilled." [laughs]

[conspiratorial] "But citizens, keep your wits about you in the shadows. We're receiving reports of empty-handed candidates lurking in the alleys outside the Lounge. Some poor student got ambushed tonight! Fortunately, our Copper-rank heroes stepped in... I hear one of them shattered a mugger's ribs with a single, DEVASTATING punch! [loudly] JUSTICE in the lower blocks! A brutal reminder that not everyone who came to Vumbua belongs here."

[deliberate] "And speaking of belonging... The sun is up. The Loom awaits! Today is the day, candidates. Track Assignments... the final reckoning... and of course... The First Vumbua Circuit-Run! [rapid-fire] The rigs are primed, the energy is surging, and the Apex Ring is ready to ROAR!"

[smooth] "This is Valerius Sterling, signing off. Keep your batteries charged, and your eyes on the spires!"
