[excited] "Good morning, Vumbua! The sun is shining on the Sky-Spire, the Deep-Hull is thrumming with fresh steam, and the smell of fear... oh, excuse me, the smell of *opportunity* is in the air! I'm Valerius Sterling, your voice in the steam, broadcasting LIVE on the very first day of Academy classes!"

[deliberate] "Listen closely, candidates. Today is the day the real work begins. You'll be sweating over Cartography up in the Spire, calculating Kinematics in the Hull, and desperately trying not to blow off your own eyebrows in Advanced Steam Engineering down in the Walker-Core! Whether you're mastering the rigid, 'safe' geometry of Harmony Magic, or wrestling with the... *unpredictable* Variance of the Clans, remember: Vumbua doesn't reward the mediocre. Only the best survive the curriculum!"

[smooth] "But let's be honest, you're not just here for the lectures. You're here for the sky. You're here for the Proving Voyage! And to help you choose your destiny, we are kicking off our brand new segment: *The Captains' Manifest*! Each week, I'll be interviewing the brave (and sometimes foolish) souls offering berths for the one-month expedition."

[rapid-fire] "First up in the studio, a man whose boiler runs hotter than a dragon's breath. He's betting on a vertical climb up a Storm-Needle mountain... Captain Ignis 'Scorch' of the Iron-Union!"

**Captain Scorch:** [intense, slightly manic, fast pacing] "Speed is survival, Sterling! We aren't just climbing that mountain; we're launching up it! I'm running the engine at 120% until it melts or we win! I need candidates with Heat-Resistance, high Constitution, and no fear of heights. If you can handle the heat, you're on my crew."

**Valerius:** [amused, slightly appalled] "Well, that sounds... entirely reckless! And speaking of surviving the impossible, our next guest is a living legend. He literally wrote the book on survival—*The Percussive Maintenance Guide (Vol. 4)*! Please welcome Captain 'Iron-Hide' Jorah!"

**Captain Iron-Hide:** [gruff, exhausted but sturdy, deep resonance] "The ship breaks before the crew does, Sterling. That's the rule. I'm taking the *Bulwark* out on patrol. We don't run from the beasts. We tank them. I need Guardians who know the 'Piston-Lock' safety maneuver by heart. You'll take damage, sure. But I'll bring you home."

**Valerius:** [smooth] "Fascinating... A true working-class hero. Well, there you have it, candidates! Do you want to risk explosion with Captain Scorch, or endure a brutal beating with Captain Iron-Hide? The choice is yours. Choose wisely, secure your berths, and remember..."

[grand] "...History is written by the first."

[Transatlantic accent]
[deliberate] "This is Valerius Sterling, signing off. Keep your batteries charged, and your eyes on the spires!"
