## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### Agenda in Vumbua

They hate the "Modular City" aesthetic of Vumbua. They want to pave the Ash-Blood Isles and build a static stone fortress. They are trying to evict the [[mizizi|Mizizi]] from their "unsafe" cliffside dorms (Block 04).

### Conflict Lines

- Despise the [[iron-union|Iron-Union]]'s "temporary" metal machines
- Want to replace Vumbua's modular construction with permanent stone
- Their efforts to "condemn" Block 04 directly threaten [[britt|Britt]] and [[aggie|Aggie]]'s housing

### Key Agent

**Architect Stone.** A dwarf with geomantic granite hands who is trying to condemn Block 04-Root. He views the [[mizizi|Mizizi]]'s organic architecture as structurally unsound and culturally backwards.
