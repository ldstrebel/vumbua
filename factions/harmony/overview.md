# Harmony (The Direction)

*The Ruling Coalition of the Shattered Circuit*

## Overview
Harmony is not a single bloodline but a coalition of **Great Houses** and **Guilds** that separated from the ancient empire to preserve "Direction" and "Structure". They believe that without their guidance, the other clans would drift into chaos or stagnation.

They define themselves by **Expansion, Technology, and Law**.

## The Great Houses (The Families)

These families hold seats on the **High Council** and effectively run the civilization.

### House Vane (The Shield)
* **Domain**: Defense, Walls, Military Strategy.
* **Philosophy**: "Safety through Separation."
* **Key Members**:
    *   **Lord Commander Titus Vane**: Leader of the military, believes in aggressive expansion.
    *   **[[Dean Isolde Vane]]**: Head of [[Vumbua Academy]], Titus's sister. Believes in understanding over conquest (the "Black sheep").

### House Vox (The Spark)
* **Domain**: Energy, Crystal Batteries, Surge Protection.
* **Philosophy**: "Power is Life."
* **Origin**: Based at **Umbra Mountain**, source of the umber crystals used in Vox battery technology.
* **Key Members**:
    *   **Arch-Duke Cymon Vox**: The ruthless patriarch who controls the battery supply.
    *   **Seraphina "Serra" Vox**: His runaway daughter, hiding at the Academy as "[[Serra Vox]]".
    *   **[[professor-kante|Professor Kante]]**: A tortoise researcher from [[House Gilded]] whose work is sponsored by House Vox. Key figure in harmonics research and creator of multiple Vox battery generations.

### House Sterling (The Sail)
* **Domain**: Trade, Logistics, Fleet Command.
* **Philosophy**: "Movement is Wealth."
* **Key Members**:
    *   **[[Valentine Sterling]] Sr.**: Legendary explorer. Discovered the [[Mizizi]] ("[[Valentine Sterling Sr.|The Paper Man]]") one week before Thorne found the [[Ash-Bloods]], but moved on because integration work bored him.
    *   **Captain Elara Thorne**: Famous exploranaut who discovered the Ash-Blood Isles 24 months ago.
    *   **[[Valerius Sterling]] Jr.**: Gold-rank student, Captain of Squad 01 (The Echelon). Carries his father's opportunism.

### House Gilded (The Vault)
* **Domain**: Treasury, Banking, Resonance Infrastructure.
* **Philosophy**: "Everything has a Price."
* **Origin**: Based in the city of **Gilded**, home of the original Chime Spires that first harnessed ether into power.
* **Notes**: Built their fortune on the resonator monopoly, then pivoted to banking after the Night of Sparks (~400 years ago). Often in conflict with House Vox over resource pricing.

## The Guilds (The Labor)

While Houses lead, Guilds do the work. The most powerful is:

### The Iron-Union
* **Domain**: Engines, Boilers, Construction.
* **Members**: Engineers, Mechanics, Laborers (like Loami's family).
* **Relationship**: Tension with the Houses. They feel they keep the city running while Houses take the credit.

## Note on "Harmony" as a Clan
To the other clans ([[Mizizi]], [[Ash-Bloods]], etc.), **Harmony** is viewed as a single monolithic block. They don't distinguish between a Vane and a Vox. To an Ash-Blood, they are all "The Cold Ones" or "The Metal-Men".
