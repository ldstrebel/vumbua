## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### Agenda in Vumbua: Monopoly

They know the Storm Chasers ([[Renali|Cloud-Kin]]/[[fulgur-born|Fulgur-Born]]) control the jet streams. They want to find them *first* to secure exclusive trade rights to the high-altitude routes. Whoever controls the sky-highways controls all commerce.

### The Black Market

The Syndicate operates through proxies, buying the loyalty of low-rank students to map unofficial trade routes and smuggling corridors.

### Key Agent

**Broker Silas.** A slick fixer in the Celestial Lounge trying to buy the loyalty of Rust-tier students (like [[lucky|Lucky]]) to map the black market routes. He offers "favors" instead of cash---a new receipt, a better dorm assignment, a message delivered home.
