# The Trench-Kin (The Abyssal)

> *"The Surface is hell. We only go up to trade. The deep is safe. The pressure is a hug from the gods."*

## What Players Know

Almost nothing. The Trench-Kin are completely unknown to Harmony and to the other player characters. The only surface contact they have maintained is the Exchange Ritual with the [[Wadi]] ([[Wadi|River Clan]]), trading members through deep underwater shafts.

[[Iggy]]---the party's "Earthkin" roommate---emerged from the water at the docks on Intake Day, clearly uncomfortable in the open air. He wears heavy fluid-filled goggles, crumbles in low pressure, and finds comfort in weight and compression. No one has questioned his origin beyond assuming he's some kind of earth-elemental mutation.

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### The Element & The Node

| | |
|---|---|
| **Element** | Tectonic Pressure (Deep Earth) |
| **Node** | The Sleeping God |
| **Rarity** | Inaccessible |
| **Integration Status** | 0% (Hidden / Uncontacted) |

The Sleeping God stabilizes the continental plates. Without this Node, the continents would drift too fast and tear the rail lines apart. Harmony has no idea a civilization exists below---they believe the deep crust is lifeless rock and pressurized gas.

### The Crisis: "The Bends"

The pressure in the Trench-Kin caves is dropping. Their eyes bulge; their blood threatens to boil. The weight of the ocean is lifting, and it is killing them. The tectonic plates are slipping. The gods are dead---or sleeping.

### The Ancestral Taboo: "The Surface Burn"

The light above burns the eyes. Trench-Kin wear heavy, fluid-filled goggles when topside to survive the "vacuum" of surface pressure. Going to the surface is considered an act of desperation or madness.

### First Contact Story: "The Deafening Whale"

> We have never seen a "Human." But last cycle, a "Deafening Metal Whale" (submarine) passed through the water above our cave. It did not swim like a beast; it hummed with a rhythm that hurt our ears. It dropped a glowing metal egg (probe) near our entrance. We buried it in sand because the light hurt our eyes.

### The Broken Exchange

The [[Ash-Bloods]] were scheduled to send a bride to the Trench-Kin. They didn't show up. Instead, they dropped an Obsidian Tablet down the exchange shaft:

> *"The Heat has returned. We need nothing from the Dark. Look to the Light."*

The Trench-Kin Elders were terrified. They buried the tablet, fearing that curiosity about the "Light" would destroy their society.

### Iggy's True Origin

**[[Iggy]]** was a deep-tunnel scrapper who found the buried tablet. He didn't read it as an insult---he read it as an invitation. He isn't on the surface to conquer; he is here to find out why the [[Ash-Bloods]] stopped coming. He suspects the surface isn't a "Burning Hellscape" (as the Elders teach) but a place of infinite energy.

He is not a diplomat---he is an **Unregistered Infiltrator**. He passed the entrance exams by simply not listing a home address and letting the registrars assume he was a generic "Earth-Elemental" construct. He represents the potential of a people who have not yet introduced themselves.

### Integration Potential

If Harmony ever discovers the Trench-Kin:
- **Inward Flow:** Trench-crystals could harden Harmony hulls
- **Outward Flow:** Harmony pumps could aerate their water
- **The Value:** Stability---the continental anchor that keeps the Stitching from tearing itself apart

### The Shattered Circuit Role

In [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Vane]]'s theory, the Trench-Kin are **The Miners (Resources)**---the stabilizing foundation of the ancient empire.
