# The Renali (Air Clan)

> *"We pity the ground-dwellers. They do not know how to fly---only how to burn fuel to fight gravity."*

## What Players Know

The Renali are known to exist but are elusive. They rarely land, making them a curiosity rather than a political force. Most [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]] students assume [[zephyr|Zephyr]]---the energetic newcomer who arrived via the last Exchange Ritual---is an eccentric Renali pilot. They ride massive insects called Air-Bees and live on floating islands in the "Vapor Sea."

### Source References

- **[[session-02|Session 2]]** — [[Percival Vane-Smythe III|Percy]]'s Sixfold Theory referenced Air clans as one of the missing pieces *(Scene 4: The Speculators)*
- **[[session-02|Session 2]]** — [[zephyr|Zephyr]]'s purple lightning bolt suggested Storm-Kin abilities; students assume she is Renali *(Scene 7: The Lightning)*

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### The Element & The Node

| | |
|---|---|
| **Element** | Wind (Gas/Gravity) |
| **Node** | The Sacred Wind |
| **Rarity** | Abundant / Untamed |
| **Biome** | The "Vapor Sea" (Floating Islands) |
| **Integration Status** | Unknown (Remote) |

Movement and mixture. Wind spreads seeds and regulates temperature. Harmony ships are heavy; they need Renali updrafts to save fuel. The Renali control the "Highways" of the sky.

### The Crisis: "The Falling"

The floating islands are drifting downward as gravity wins. The Vapor Sea is getting thinner. Without intervention, the Renali will eventually crash to the surface---a fate worse than death for a people who have never touched the ground.

### Natural Adaptation

The Renali ride **Air-Bees**---giant insects steered by silk sails and insect pheromones. They do not use engines. Their meandering flight path creates micro-connections with distant Nodes, keeping their magic surprisingly potent despite their isolation.

### The "Bride Exchange" Ritual

The Renali maintain strict isolation while ensuring genetic diversity:
1. Strict orders: Do not see the ground, do not speak, do not merge crystals
2. Riders fly Air-Bees into the fog layer where visibility is zero
3. They drop a clan member into the mist and blindly snatch a rope holding a person from a ground clan
4. The Air-Bees must *never* touch the ground

### The Ancestral Taboo: "The Heavy Heart"

> A Rider who listened too long to the songs of the Volcano Clan found himself becoming "spiritually heavy." His Air-Bee refused to carry him. He didn't fall; he just sank. Never let the ground-dwellers anchor your mind.

### First Contact Story: "The Caught Cloud"

> The sky broke. A massive metal cloud (Harmony Airship) fell from the upper stream. It was heavy and dead, tumbling toward the ocean. We flew our Bees to catch it. We wove a net of silk and saved the metal-men. They were strange---they did not know how to fly, only how to burn fuel to fight gravity. We pity them.

### View of the Academy: "The Stone Cage"

The Academy is heavy. It sits on the ground. It disgusts the Renali. But they know the Academy has the "Lodestones" (Magnets) that could push their islands back up into the sky.

### Zephyr's Secret

Most students assume [[zephyr|Zephyr]] is Renali. She is actually **[[fulgur-born|Fulgur-Born]] (Storm-Chaser)**---a completely different storm-based faction from the north. Only [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Vane]] knows her true origin. The Renali themselves remain largely uncontacted.

### The Shattered Circuit Role

In [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Vane]]'s theory, the Renali are **The Architects (Vision)**---the high-altitude perspective that once guided the empire's expansion.

### The Lost Symbiosis

The Renali were once bonded with the [[wadi|Wadi]] ([[Wadi|River Clan]]). Their air sustained the Wadi's underwater homes. When the Renali retreated to higher altitudes, the rivers dried up. Restoring this connection is one of the keys to the Shattered Circuit.
