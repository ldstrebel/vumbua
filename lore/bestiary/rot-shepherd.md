## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### Clan Lore (Mizizi / [[Britt]] & [[Aggie]]): "The Gardener"

These are the **immune system of the forest**. They collect the dead to recycle them. They are peaceful unless you break a "Live Branch."

**To safely interact:** Bow and offer it "dead matter" (compost, old food, leather). It will trade you rare medicinal herbs for the "trash."

### Recent Incident

[[Dr. Rose Halloway]] (Squad 05) burned a patch of "weeds" near the perimeter. A Rot-Shepherd retaliated by throwing a boulder through her lab window. Harmony calls it an "Unprovoked Attack."
