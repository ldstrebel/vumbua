# The Dual-Codex: Harmony vs. The Wilds

The Academy views the frontier as a resource to be harvested. The Clans view it as a living entity to be negotiated with.

**Mechanic:** Players can roll **Knowledge (Academic)** to get the Harmony entry, or **Knowledge (Culture/Nature)** to get the Clan entry. Usually, the Clan entry contains the *actual* solution to the encounter.

## Creatures of the Shattered Nodes

- [[Ether-Jelly]] - Phase-shifting jellyfish that are actually the memories of Dissolved lands
- [[Void-Beast]] - Shadow predators that hunt fear, not heat
- [[Rot-Shepherd]] - The immune system of the [[Mizizi]] Forest
- [[Whispering Moth]] - Voice-stealing insects that lure travelers to their doom

## World Phenomena

- [[The Bleed]] - Where reality dissolves at the map's edge
- [[The Minimum]] - The energy crisis threatening Harmony
- [[Pre-Stitch Artifacts]] - Ancient tech immune to the Minimum
