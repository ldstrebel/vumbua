# Harmony's Integrated Nodes

Every territory in Harmony is anchored by a **node**---a pocket of concentrated reality that produces a unique elemental resource. When integrated, these nodes contribute to Harmony's [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] and provide materials that shape civilization.

## Node Power Scale

| Rating | Description | Global Amplitude Impact | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Major** | Transforms the lives of large sentient populations; forms the backbone of civilization | +100 to +800 amps | Gilded (Chime Spires), Feltland (Live Soil), Juxta (Lift Stone), Octo (Speaking Stones) |
| **Moderate** | Significant resource with broad applications; supports multiple industries | +30 to +100 amps | Most integrated Harmony nodes |
| **Minor** | Useful but limited in scope; often a single unique property | +5 to +30 amps | Trail-Tail Trench, smaller frontier nodes |
| **Shattered (Major)** | The six ancient clan nodes---Major in size but currently outputting Minor power due to the Shattered Circuit effect | Varies (see anomaly) | Ash-Bloods, Mizizi, Trench-Kin, Renali, Wadi, Fulgur-Born |

The distinction between major and minor is not purely about raw power---it's about the degree to which the node has transformed sentient life around it.

## The Integrated Nodes of Harmony

### 1. Gilded (Major)
- **Resource:** Chime Spires (Resonators)
- **Faction:** [[House Gilded]] ([[House Gilded|The Highborne]])
- **Description:** Home city of [[House Gilded]]. The Chime Spires are musical, organ-like structures that synchronize raw ether into usable power. They are the foundation of Harmony's entire energy infrastructure.
- **Status:** Core Harmony territory. The original spires still function as the backbone of the power grid.

### 2. Umbra Mountain (Major)
- **Resource:** Umber Crystals
- **Faction:** House Vox (The Spark)
- **Description:** Home mountain of House Vox. Source of the umber crystals used in every generation of Vox crystal batteries, from the first post-Night-of-Sparks surge protectors to the current Panda line.
- **Status:** Core Harmony territory. Heavily mined and industrialized.

### 3. Feltland (Major)
- **Resource:** Live Soil
- **Description:** A vast plain near the seat of Harmony Prime. The soil is extraordinarily fertile---essentially supercharged fertilizer that accelerates growth far beyond natural rates.
- **Status:** Core Harmony territory. Agricultural backbone of the empire.

### 4. Octo (Major)
- **Resource:** Speaking Stones
- **Description:** One-way communication stones. The first stone transmits; the second stone receives and reproduces the message. This is how long-distance communication works across Harmony---essentially magical radio.
- **Status:** Core Harmony territory. Speaking Stone networks span the empire.

### 5. Juxta (Major)
- **Resource:** Lift Stone
- **Description:** When an object is fully encapsulated in Lift Stone, it weighs only half what it should. The stone itself is just barely weightless (net-zero weight). Essential for construction, shipping, and the mobile architecture of cities like Vumbua.
- **Status:** Core Harmony territory. Critical infrastructure material.

### 6. Shepta
- **Resource:** Whetstone
- **Description:** Liquid stone that hardens within seconds of being separated from its source pool. Essentially instant concrete. Pour it, shape it, and it sets almost immediately.
- **Status:** Integrated. Major construction resource.

### 7. Lenoa
- **Resource:** Friction Needles
- **Description:** Two needles struck together eliminate friction from the next friction interaction they encounter, until the needles break. Strike the pair, touch them to an ice skate, and the skate glides across ground as if on ice---the friction is absorbed into the needles instead of being applied.
- **Status:** Integrated. Used in transportation and industrial applications.

### 8. Relina
- **Resource:** Soft Forge
- **Description:** A lake in which anything submerged immediately loses its rigid shape and becomes malleable. While within the lake, objects can be reshaped freely. Extremely dangerous---works on organic matter too, so hands lose their shape if submerged. The city constantly innovates clever tools and techniques for safe use.
- **Status:** Integrated. Premier metallurgy and crafting center.

### 9. Minnow
- **Resource:** Living Scent Wood
- **Description:** A forest where, as long as a tree is still alive, anything that touches it permanently gains the scent of that wood. The effect is irreversible and lasts forever.
- **Status:** Integrated. Source of luxury goods, preservation, and ceremonial materials.

### 10. Bloomfield
- **Resource:** Clockwork Blooms
- **Faction:** [[Scrivener Guild]] ([[Scrivener Guild|The Loreborne]])
- **Description:** Flowers that bloom with mechanical precision every 60 seconds. For centuries, Clockwork Blooms were the standard unit of timekeeping across Harmony before more precise instruments were developed. The Scriveners adopted these as their timekeeping standard, essential for synchronizing maps, logs, and research across the empire.
- **Status:** Integrated. Historical significance; still used ceremonially.

### 11. Prima
- **Resource:** Dew Crystals
- **Description:** Crystals that condense water from ambient air, producing roughly a cup of clean water each. Invaluable in desert regions and aboard ships where fresh water is scarce.
- **Status:** Integrated. Essential survival resource for frontier operations.

### 12. Settika
- **Resource:** Prism Falls
- **Description:** Water that reveals the true nature of whatever it touches. Rot, disease, structural weakness, and hidden flaws become immediately visible when Prism Falls water is poured over them.
- **Status:** Integrated. Used in medicine, engineering inspection, and food safety.

### 13. Nstyl
- **Resource:** Silent Silt
- **Description:** When a handful or more of this silt is gathered in one spot, it absorbs all sound in the surrounding area. The city that grew around this node communicates entirely through sign language---spoken language is physically impossible there.
- **Status:** Integrated. Used in stealth operations, hospitals, and sound-sensitive environments.

### 14. Elysium
- **Resource:** Snow Sand
- **Description:** Desert sand that causes vivid hallucinations and illusions of whatever the affected person most desires. Highly dangerous and highly regulated.
- **Status:** Integrated. Strictly controlled; used in medicine and interrogation.

### 15. Bay of Breath
- **Resource:** Breathable Algae
- **Description:** An algae colony that produces and purifies breathable air. Essential for deep-hull operations, submarine expeditions, and enclosed environments.
- **Status:** Integrated. Critical life-support resource.

## Unintegrated Nodes (The Shattered Circuit)

The six ancient clan nodes exist outside Harmony's network. They are Major in size but currently output only Minor power levels, because they are metaphysically "reaching out" to their missing siblings and bleeding energy into the void.

| Clan | Node Element | Circuit Role |
|---|---|---|
| Ash-Bloods | Fire/Heat | Power (The Engines) |
| Mizizi | Memory/Growth | Memory (The Archivists) |
| Trench-Kin | Pressure/Resources | Resources (The Miners) |
| Renali | Air/Wind | Vision (The Architects) |
| Wadi | Water/Life | Life (The Sustainers) |
| Fulgur-Born | Lightning/Storm | *(Unknown)* |

### The Trail-Tail Trench (Minor, Unintegrated)

- **Resource:** Trail-Tail Seeds
- **Description:** When ingested, these seeds cause the consumer to leave a glowing trail of light behind them, like a Tron light-cycle. Found in the deep waters of the [[Trench-Kin]] territory. Fish there use the seeds naturally, creating bioluminescent trails through the dark water.
- **Status:** Not integrated. No city or settlement---this is a wild node in [[Trench-Kin]] territory.
