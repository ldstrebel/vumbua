# The World of the Great Stitching

The world is not a static globe; it is a disjointed reality waiting to be pulled together.

## Core Concepts

### The Great Stitching

Nodes act as gravity wells for reality. When a new Node is claimed and harmonized, it physically pulls the new continent slowly toward the central Harmony continent. The world is literally being built/stitched together over time.

### The Threat (The Ether/Nether)

If civilization stops expanding, the reality of claimed lands begins to dissolve. This has happened before, creating the [[The Bleed|Dissolved Lands]].

### The Crisis

For centuries, Harmony had excess power. Now, for the first time, they are approaching [[The Minimum]]. If they dip below the threshold, Harmony tech will begin to lose charge.

## Phenomena

- [[the-bleed|The Bleed]] - Where reality dissolves at the map's edge
- [[The Minimum]] - The energy crisis threatening all of Harmony
- [[The Power System]] - [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]], Resonators, and Crystal Batteries
- [[Pre-Stitch Artifacts]] - Ancient tech that works without magic

## Territory

- [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]] - The 16+ nodes that form Harmony's territory and power grid

## Integration Mechanics

Integration is the process of locking two disparate realities into a single flow. It requires a simultaneous, two-way energy exchange:

1. **Inward Flow:** Raw material of the new Node powers Harmony tech at 100% efficiency
2. **Outward Flow:** Harmony batteries power a local necessity in the new territory
3. **The Lock:** When both flows occur, realities fuse and a Safe Lane opens

See the [[Glossary]] for detailed term definitions.

## Map Zones

1. **The Vapor Sea:** The cloud layer separating the peaks. Requires airships or Air-Bees to cross.
2. **The [[Wadi|Dry Vein]]:** The desert canyon of the Wadi ([[Wadi|River Clan]]).
3. **The Petrifaction Fields:** Where the [[Mizizi]] live. A forest turned to stone, now overgrown with massive fungi.
4. **The Obsidian Ridges:** Volcanic glass and magma. Home of the [[Ash-Bloods]].
5. **The Abyssal Trench:** High-pressure underwater vents. Home of the [[Trench-Kin]].
6. **Tartannen:** The mythical "First City" of the old empire, rumored to be somewhere in this sector.
