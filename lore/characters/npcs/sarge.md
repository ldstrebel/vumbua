## Overview
"Sarge" is a Rust-tier veteran, likely an older student or a TA/Worker who keeps getting pulled into squads to keep them alive. He works in the boiler rooms with [[Lomi]]---they know each other from the workers' campfire social hours.

## Session Appearances

### Session 1
- Recognized [[Lomi]] coming out of the exams: *"Loaves? Loaves, we made it. Can you believe it?"*
- Admitted he barely passed: *"I just looked at the typewriter. Seems about right."*
- Overwhelmed but doing it "for the lads"

### Session 2
- At the Block 99 bonfire, leaning against a wall watching [[Lucky]] sell Engine Grease, kicking empty bottles disapprovingly

## Personality
- **Not Bitter, Protective:** He isn't bitter about his station; he's protective. He warns [[Ignatius]] about his fire because he's seen unchecked energy kill good people.
- **Goal:** Wants his squad to survive the physics of the world, avoiding the politics.
- Disapproves of [[Lucky]]'s hustling but doesn't intervene directly
