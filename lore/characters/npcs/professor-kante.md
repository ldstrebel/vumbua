# Professor Kante

> "The numbers do not lie. They simply wait for us to ask the right question."

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Professor of Harmonics |
| **Race** | Tortoise (long-lived) |
| **Affiliation** | [[House Gilded]] (origin), House Vox (research sponsor), [[Vumbua Academy]] |
| **Location** | [[Walker-Core]] — Power Plant, catwalk office |
| **Status** | Active |
| **Accent** | Indian, slow-speaking |
| **First Appearance** | [[session-02.5\|Session 2.5]] |

## Overview

Professor Kante is one of Harmony's foremost researchers in harmonics---the science of ether resonance, [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] measurement, and battery design. His tortoise lifespan has allowed him to personally oversee the development and release of multiple generations of Vox crystal batteries. He is respected by both [[House Gilded]] (his house of origin) and House Vox (who sponsor his research), a rare bridge between two frequently feuding houses.

He is devoted to his work as a professor and researcher at the Academy, spending his nights taking measurements and filling whiteboards with questions no one else is asking. He wears a top hat and Bridgerton-style outfit.

## What Players Know

**[[Iggy]] only (Session 2.5):**
- Met Kante in the power room late at night — Kante was watching him sketch machinery
- Kante is a tortoise professor of harmonics; slow-speaking, Indian accent, wears a top hat and Bridgerton-style outfit
- He explained the [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]], the Ash-Blood Anomaly, and the Night of Sparks
- His theory: integration works through cultural connection between peoples
- He gave [[Iggy]] an umber crystal and invited him to return for more collaboration
- Iggy mentioned "the Exchange" — Kante had never heard of it
- Kante suspects Iggy is from an isolated, unintegrated sect but didn't push further

*Other players have not met Professor Kante.*

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### The Whiteboard

Kante takes measurements every night. His office whiteboard tells the story of his growing alarm:

- **Historical comparison:** [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] max line from 50 years vs. 100 years ago (showing the plateau and decline)
- **"Where is the Ash-Blood surge?"** - The central question. A major node integration should have increased the [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] by +300 to +800 amps. The [[Ash-Bloods]] only produced ~20.
- **Scrapped projections:** The Apex 1 battery line was designed for a post-surge world (Global Amplitude of 900-1400). Those projections sit next to a red "SCRAPPED" note.
- **The storage line question:** "What happens when the Global Amplitude drops below the storage line?" If the amplitude dips below what the Panda line batteries can regulate, power output becomes erratic as the ether field's natural breathing overwhelms the surge protection.

### The Two Problems

1. **The Missing Surge:** The Ash-Blood integration should have been a historic moment---a major node producing the kind of amplitude jump not seen since the Night of Sparks (~400 years ago). Instead, barely a blip. Why?
2. **The Apex 1 Crisis:** His entire next-generation battery line is now useless. All the marketing, all the engineering, all the promises House Vox made to their investors---moot. He doesn't know what to do.

### Relationship with Iggy

Kante will discover [[Iggy]] exploring the power room and recognize a kindred curiosity. He will recruit Iggy to help investigate the missing surge, seeing in the young student a fresh perspective uncontaminated by Harmony's assumptions.

### Personality Notes

- Speaks slowly and deliberately---every word chosen with care
- Has the patience of someone who has lived through centuries of Harmony's history
- Genuinely passionate about the science, not the politics
- Frustrated that House Vox cares more about the Apex 1 marketing failure than the underlying mystery
- Voice: *"What do you like, know?"* — deliberate character voice (do not smooth)
