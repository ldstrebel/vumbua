> The following information has been narrated by the GM but is not known to the player characters.

### Planning Notes
In the lore dump, Ratchet welcomes [[Lomi]] to Block 99: *"Welcome to the boiler room, kid. Don't believe the Dean. This place isn't a school; it's a battery, and we're the acid."*
