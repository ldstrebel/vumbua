## Overview
Valentine is the charismatic, social face of the Sterling family. Unlike his rigid cousin [[Valerius Sterling]], Val is approachable, charming, and deeply embedded in the social fabric of the Academy. He hosts the unauthorized late-night radio show that recaps campus events.

## Relationships
- **[[Valerius Sterling Sr.]]**: His father, the legendary explorer. Val inherited his father's charisma and love for the spotlight.
- **[[Valerius Sterling]]**: His older cousin and Captain of Squad 01. Valerius considers Val "frivolous"; Val thinks Valerius needs to loosen up.
- **[[Ignatius]]**: Met in the courtyard after Intake. Val was amused by the soot/fire but hesitant to touch him.

## Session Appearances

### Session 1
- **The Courtyard Encounter:** Met [[Ignatius]] immediately after the intake exam.
- **The Interaction:** Recognized Ignatius as an [[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]].
- **The Handshake:** Hesitated to shake hands ("Will your hand burn me?"), then wiped his hand of soot and stormed off, spitting.
- **Vibe:** "Bridgerton-esque," but with a chaotic social energy.

## Personality
- **Charismatic:** Natural orator, perfect for radio.
- **Social Butterfly:** Knows everyone, hears everything.
- **Clean:** Obsessed with appearance (hence the soot reaction), but willing to get "dirty" for a good story (metaphorically).
