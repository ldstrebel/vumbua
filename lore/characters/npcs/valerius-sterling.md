# Valerius "Val" Sterling

> "Chaos is just failure you haven't named yet."
> — *Valerius Sterling*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Squad 01 (The Echelon) - Captain (Gold Rank) / Paladin |
| **Affiliation** | Harmony (Sterling Family), [[Vumbua Academy]], [[House Gilded]] |
| **Status** | Active |
| **Archetype** | The Burdened Legacy |
| **First Appearance** | Not yet on-screen |

## Overview
Valerius Sterling is the Captain of Squad 01 ("The Echelon") and the Academy's "Golden Boy." He is technically brilliant, rigidly disciplined, and deeply burdened by the expectations of his family. He is the **cousin** of [[Valentine Sterling]], though he considers Val's radio antics a distraction from the true mission.

## Relationships
- **[[Valentine Sterling]]**: His younger cousin. Valerius views him as "uncalibrated" and frivolous.
- **[[Valerius Sterling Sr.]]**: His famous uncle (Valentine's father). Valerius was named after him and feels the pressure to live up to the name more than Valentine does.

## Personality
- **Public Persona:** Arrogant, perfect, and critical of "Variance" (chaos/unpredictability). He often antagonizes the party, calling them "Uncalibrated."
- **Hidden Depth:** He is terrified of failure. He believes that order is the only thing keeping the Venture from falling apart. His antagonism comes from fear that the party's chaotic methods will destroy the fragile balance he fights to maintain.

## Relationships
- **[[Serra Vox|Seraphina Vox]]:** His teammate and fellow noble. He respects her talent but worries about her eccentricities.
- **The Party:** Rivals. He specifically targets them during assessments.
- **Valerius Sterling Sr.:** His father, a renowned explorer whose shadow looms large over him.

## GM Narration [NOT YET REVEALED TO PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information has been narrated by the GM but is not known to the player characters.

### Backstory
Groomed to lead the Venture since birth. He has never actually touched dirt; his hands are magically calloused to look "rugged." The Sterling family reputation is a heavy, gilded shield he carries everywhere.

### Flaw
Narcissism. He cannot process the idea of someone being more "efficient" than him.

### Valerius Sterling Sr.
During the Silent Era, [[Valerius Sterling Sr.|Sterling Sr.]] led suicide missions into the blind mist alongside Captain Elara Thorne. But while Thorne was motivated by the existential threat she saw in the Council data, Sterling Sr. cared only about the massive bounties offered for exploration. His son carries the same opportunism.
