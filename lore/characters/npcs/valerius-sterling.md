## Overview
Valerius Sterling is the older cousin of [[Valentine Sterling]] and a fixture at Vumbua Academy, having been there for several years. He hosts the popular (and possibly unauthorized) radio show that recaps academy events. He is named after his famous uncle, [[Valentine Sterling Sr.]].

## Relationships
- **[[Valentine Sterling]]**: His younger cousin and the family Scion/Student. Valerius watches over him (and critiques his performance on air).
- **[[Valentine Sterling Sr.]]**: His famous uncle and namesake.

## Personality
- **Public Persona:** Arrogant, perfect, and critical of "Variance" (chaos/unpredictability). He often antagonizes the party, calling them "Uncalibrated."
- **Hidden Depth:** He is terrified of failure. He believes that order is the only thing keeping the Venture from falling apart. His antagonism comes from fear that the party's chaotic methods will destroy the fragile balance he fights to maintain.
