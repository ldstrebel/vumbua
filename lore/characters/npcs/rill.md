# Rill (The River-Born)

**Aliases:** Real, Rill, The River-Born
**Role:** Dean's Assistant / Mizizi Researcher / "Traitor" / Futurist
**Affiliation:** Harmony (Publicly [[Mizizi]], Secretly [[Wadi]])
**Status:** Active
**Archetype:** The Futurist

## Overview
Rill is a researcher at [[Vumbua Academy]] who is publicly known as a **[[Mizizi]]** traitor who left the Forest two years ago. **Secretly, she is a [[Wadi]] ([[Wadi|River Clan]])** member who has integrated so perfectly that she passes as Mizizi. She arrived at the Academy **2 months ago** after spending time in the "Silent Zones" between leaving the forest and joining Harmony. [[Serra Vox]] describes her as *"one of the greatest inventors in our age."*

## Session 2 Appearance
Rill appeared on stage during the Dean's Welcome ceremony, pulling [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Isolde]] back behind the curtain. She waved good luck to the [[Mizizi]] students ([[Britt]] and [[Aggie]]).

Later at the Block 99 bonfire, Rill appeared after [[Zephyr]]'s lightning incident to retrieve her: *"There you are! We've been looking all over for you."* She bribed Zephyr with hot chocolate and dragged her away.

Before leaving, she recognized [[Britt]] and [[Aggie]] and told them to come find her after class tomorrow, pointing to the grass-covered building inset into the hill.

When [[Ignatius]] asked [[Zephyr]]'s name, Rill called back: *"Her name is Zephyr, [[Ignatius|Lava Boy]]."*

## Timeline

- **2 Months Ago:** Arrived at [[Vumbua Academy]] as a researcher.
- **Session 2:** Appeared at Dean's Welcome and bonfire; managing [[Zephyr]] on Dean's behalf.

## Personality
- **Intelligent, Determined:** She loves the forest, but knows the Elders' "Stagnation" doctrine is suicide.
- **Goal:** Joined Harmony to find a cure for the "Eternal Growth" cancer/data corruption affecting the [[Mizizi]].
- **Connection:** Knows [[Britt]] and [[Aggie]] from her time in the forest. They may not know her true [[Wadi]] nature.
