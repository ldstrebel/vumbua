## GM Narration [NOT YET REVEALED TO PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information has been narrated by the GM but is not known to the player characters.

### Backstory
An ex-priest of the Emberkin who was banished for "Heresy" when he claimed the Ancestors were screaming for help.

### Bond
The "Living Flame" he carries in a specialized lantern---he says it's his father's soul.

### Flaw
Paranoia. He believes every Harmony official is trying to "snuff out" his light.

### Motive
To find the source of the heat-drain and stop Vumbua from "choking" the world.

### Planning Notes
In the lore dump, Pyrrhus was found in the map room circling a spot labelled "The Trench" and whispering: *"The heat isn't disappearing. It's draining... down."*
