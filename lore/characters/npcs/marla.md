## Overview

Marla is a human maintenance worker in the power room who carries the weight of a failed dream. She tried out for [[Vumbua Academy]] about two decades ago in a much smaller class and didn't make the cut.

## Backstory

Marla's intake class was brutally competitive. Out of roughly a hundred candidates, only **one** person earned the rank of Exploranaut: **Elara Thorne** (who would later go on to discover the Ash-Blood Isles). Everyone else was filtered out. Marla never got a second chance---academy rules don't allow re-entry.

## Personality

- Bitter about the system she sees as unfair
- Resentful that only one person made it from her entire class
- Feels robbed of her opportunity
- Still works at the academy because it's all she knows, but it's a daily reminder of what she couldn't achieve

## Session Appearances

### Session 2.5 - The Power Room
- Present doing maintenance in the [[Walker-Core]] when [[Iggy]] arrives
- May share her story if prompted, providing context about how competitive past classes have been
