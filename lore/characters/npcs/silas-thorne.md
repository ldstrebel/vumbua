# Silas "Old Man" Thorne

**Role:** Squad 05 (The Harvesters) - Member (Rust Tier)
**Affiliation:** [[Vumbua Academy]], Thorne Family (Black Sheep)
**Status:** Active
**Archetype:** The Archivist of Rust

## Overview
Silas Thorne is an older student (perhaps a repeating senior or lifelong learner) in the Rust Tier. He is a scrapper, a smuggler, and a technological savant who prefers "Pre-Stitch" tech.

## Personality
- Grumpy, cynical, but wise.
- **Motivation:** He collects "Pre-Stitch" tech (combustion engines, kinetic weapons) not for greed, but because he believes they are the only things that will work when the magic/Venture fails.
- **Connections:** Distant relation to [[Cassius Thorne]] (Squad 01) and Captain Aara Thorne.

## Mechanics
- **Vendor:** Can procure rare "Rust" items or scavenged parts for the party.
