# Ember

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | [[Ash-Bloods\|Ash-Blood]] Student |
| **Affiliation** | [[Ash-Bloods]], [[Vumbua Academy]] |
| **Status** | Active (mentioned but not yet appeared on-screen) |
| **First Mentioned** | [[session-02\|Session 2]] |

## Overview
Ember is an Ash-Blood student and [[Ignatius]]'s childhood cousin. She represents the **modernizer** faction among the [[Ash-Bloods]]---those who embrace Harmony's technology and prefer "clean" crystal battery energy over traditional organic fire.

## The Cultural Divide
Ember is excited to use Harmony's batteries and refuses to touch organic fire ever again. This puts her in direct opposition to traditionalists like [[Ignatius]], who views her stance as disrespectful to Ash-Blood heritage.

[[Serra Vox]] mentioned Ember during the Session 2 bonfire conversation about Ash-Blood cultural tensions.

## Personality
- Enthusiastic about Harmony's "clean" energy
- Rejects traditional fire-tending as outdated
- Represents the younger Ash-Blood generation that sees integration as liberation, not compromise

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| **[[Ignatius]]** | Childhood cousin. He considers her rejection of fire disrespectful to their heritage. |
| **[[Lady Ignis]]** | Likely aligned with Ignis's pragmatic pro-integration stance. |
