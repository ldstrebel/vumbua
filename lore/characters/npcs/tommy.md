## Overview

Tommy is a chipper gnome who works the front desk of [[Vumbua Academy]]'s power room. He's not a student---he's looking to apply to Vumbua Academy next year and took this job to be close to the action.

## Personality

- Enthusiastic and eager to please
- Easy to persuade---if someone tells him they have business in the power room or that they're there for a class, he'll wave them through without much questioning
- Doesn't actually do much; his job is mostly administrative gatekeeping that he takes lightly

## Session Appearances

### Session 2.5 - The Power Room
- [[Iggy]] encounters Tommy at the front desk when sneaking into the [[Walker-Core]] power room
- Tommy is easily convinced that [[Iggy]] has legitimate business there
