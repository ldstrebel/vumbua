### Backstory
A street urchin from the Anchorage outskirts who pickpocketed a dead candidate's Loom Receipt to get into the intake. He isn't supposed to be here at all.

### Bond
A younger sister living in the "Low-Bunks" whom he sends his extra rations to.

### Flaw
Pathological Grifter. He cannot stop the "hustle," even when it's counter-productive.

### Motive
To "fake it 'til he makes it" into a comfortable administrative job where he doesn't have to bleed.
