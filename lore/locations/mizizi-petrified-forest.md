The Petrified Forest is the homeland of the [[Mizizi]] clan — a vast expanse of fossilized mega-flora where the clan lives in hollowed-out roots, somewhere between Pandora's trees and hobbit holes.

## What Players Know

### The Forest
The forest has sheltered the [[Mizizi]] for hundreds of years, but it has recently **failed** — things have stopped dying properly. New growth appears instantly wherever they try to prune. The elders are terrified this fulfills the prophecy: *"When the world comes, things stop dying."*

### Harmony's Arrival
[[Valerius Sterling Sr.]] ("[[Valerius Sterling Sr.|The Paper Man]]") led the first expedition here, arriving in a sterile metal-studded outfit with no moss or holes. He discovered the [[Mizizi]] one week before Captain Elara Thorne found the [[Ash-Blood Isles]]. Sterling quickly moved on — integration work bored him.

Harmony provides industrial solvents and mechanical shredders to destroy the forest. In return, they take soil, bark, roots, and stone. Neither side fully understands what the other wants. The [[Mizizi]] see it as restarting the cycle of death. Logging operations near the forest edge show the forest regrowing immediately.

### The View
From the edge of the forest, the [[Ash-Blood Isles|Ash-Blood]] volcanoes are visible on the horizon. [[Britt]] and [[Aggie]] stepped out of the petrified woods into their first glimpse of "civilization" — an assault on their forest-attuned senses.
