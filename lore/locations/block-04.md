# Block 04

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Clan student housing |
| **Parent Location** | [[Vumbua Academy]] (Spire-Scape) |
| **Notable Residents** | [[Britt]], [[Aggie]] |
| **First Appearance** | [[session-01\|Session 1]] |

Block 04 is the housing block assigned to [[Mizizi]] students. It consists of modular units built into a terraced cliff face, resembling a repurposed green room — a style that would feel somewhat familiar to forest-dwellers accustomed to hollowed mega-flora.

## What Players Know

The dorm is built into a terraced cliff, with modular units stacked along the rock face. The green, organic styling sets it apart from the industrial Block 99 or standard Block 12. [[Britt]] and [[Aggie]] were assigned here during intake but chose to explore the campus rather than go directly to their room.
