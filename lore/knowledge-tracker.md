# Knowledge Tracker

> **Purpose:** Track what players know vs. GM secrets still hidden

## The Mizizi Forest

### What Players Know
- ✅ The forest is petrified/stone
- ✅ Harmony is helping them destroy it with solvents and tools
- ✅ The [[Mizizi]] philosophy: "When things stop dying, we start dying"
- ✅ [[Rill]] left the forest 2 years ago to research at Vumbua
- ✅ The forest doesn't have a clear "purpose" like other nodes---this puzzles Harmony scholars (Session 2)
- ✅ There's a problem: "too much life"---things aren't dying properly (Session 2)
- ✅ [[Mizizi]] view death as natural and celebrate the cycle; Harmony culture fears death (Session 2)
- ✅ The Mizizi have NOT been formally integrated---no seat at Harmony, just a "semi-short-term weapons trade" (Session 2)

### GM Secrets (Players Don't Know)
- ❌ The forest is a **data archive/library**
- ❌ The trees are biological hard drives storing Imperial history
- ❌ Destroying it erases thousands of years of knowledge
- ❌ The "new growth" represents hardy archive fragments
- ❌ Integration requires Mizizi bark to be turned into paper filled with knowledge

## The Power Crisis

### What Players Know
- ✅ Vumbua has "flickering lights" occasionally (might not have noticed)
- ✅ The Academy relocated recently to the Ash-Blood Isles
- ✅ Leidian is burning 80% hotter per gram in the last 2 years since integration (Session 2)
- ✅ Leidian has a halflife oscillation---heat tapers then rises again (Session 2)
- ✅ Leidian loses some potency with distance from Ash-Blood isle (Session 2)
- ✅ The boiler room uses both crystal batteries and leidian (Session 2)
- ✅ Boilers are exploding because leidian is too hot (Session 2)

### Iggy Only (Session 2.5 — via Professor Kante)
- 🔶 The Global Amplitude measures total ether energy across Harmony — increases with each node integration
- 🔶 The Global Amplitude has been declining for 30-40 years (first decline in recorded history)
- 🔶 The Ash-Blood integration only produced ~20 amp increase instead of expected +300 to +800
- 🔶 House Vox scrapped the Apex 1 battery line (Kante's next-gen battery is useless)
- 🔶 Professor Kante is investigating the Ash-Blood Anomaly — invited Iggy to collaborate
- 🔶 The Night of Sparks (~400 years ago) burned the world for two months before umber crystals existed
- 🔶 Crystal batteries (Panda 5) are surge regulators/receptors, not storage — powered by umber crystals
- 🔶 Integration works through cultural connection between peoples — not resource extraction
- 🔶 Iggy now possesses an umber crystal given by Kante

### GM Secrets (Players Don't Know)
- ❌ "The Minimum" crisis has a name (Iggy understands the concept but hasn't heard the term)
- ❌ Harmony is running out of power (Iggy senses this but doesn't know the full scope)
- ❌ The Panda line batteries (550 amps) are approaching failure threshold (specific number not shared)
- ❌ House Gilded built the original resonators; House Vox built the crystal batteries (partial — Kante mentioned his family and the Guild)
- ❌ This is why the massive intake happened
- ❌ If they fail, the lights go out forever
- ❌ Even discussing power levels is taboo (Kante spoke freely, but he may be breaking protocol)

## Integration Mechanics

### What Players Know

- ✅ The [[Ash-Bloods]] are successfully integrated (volcanoes roaring)
- ✅ The [[Mizizi]] integration is "incomplete" or "stalled"

### GM Secrets (Players Don't Know)
- ❌ Integration requires **two-way energy flow** (Inward + Outward)

- ✅ The "Sixfold Theory" exists---[[Percival Vane-Smythe III|Percy]] theorizes Earth, Air, Water clans must exist (Session 2)
- ✅ [[Ash-Bloods]] release heat by burning hotter, not sweating (Session 2)
- ✅ Ash-Bloods were going through a "Great Cooling" before Harmony found them (Session 2)

  - Ash-Bloods (Power)
  - Trench-Kin (Resources)

  - Wadi (Life)
  - Plus Harmony (Direction)
- ❌ Separation caused the Shattering, not proximity
