## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### Agenda in Vumbua: The Audit

They believe [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Vane]] is cooking the books regarding the energy output. They are investigating why the Ash-Blood and [[Mizizi]] Nodes are under-performing (the Shattered Circuit leak). They threaten to **shut down the Academy** if the numbers don't balance.

### The Inverse Power Doctrine

Formed in Era 3, the Justiciars ensure the newest/weakest members of Harmony receive the most political power---preventing the Core Families from becoming tyrants. This is why [[Lady Ignis]] was granted tremendous voting weight immediately upon arriving at Harmony Seat.

### Key Agent

**Adjudicator Kael.** A woman in a lead-lined coat who follows [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Vane]]'s staff, demanding un-redacted logs. She is methodical and incorruptible.
