## What Players Know

The Vane family built the walls that keep the monsters out. They are the military backbone of Harmony. [[Dean Isolde Vane]] is the most prominent member the players have met---she gave the welcome speech at intake. [[Celia Vance]] (Compliance Proctor) enforces safety protocols with cold precision.

## Key NPCs

- **[[Dean Isolde Vane]]** - Head of the Academy. Brilliant, Heimerdinger-esque savant. Scattered, caring, obsessed with solving the puzzle before the lights go out.
- **Lord Commander Titus Vane** - [[Dean Isolde Vane|The Dean]]'s militant rival. Believes the Academy is too soft. Pushes for aggressive "Find and Secure" exploration. Views the Clans as strategic assets to be conscripted.
- **[[Celia Vance]]** - Compliance Proctor. Cold, precise, bureaucratic. Carries a brass clipboard. The Rulebook is her only weapon against her "superior" relatives.
- **Kaelo "Ghost" Vane** - Captain. The black-ops wing of the family.
- **Captain Elara Thorne** - The exploranaut who discovered the Ash-Blood Isles 24 months ago and escorted [[Lady Ignis]] to Harmony Seat. Recently returned to assist with intake. A veteran exploranaut who had been on many ventures before this first major success.

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### The "Minimum" Motive

The Vanes know the Perimeter is failing. The Ether Beasts are evolving. They view the Shattered Circuit not as a puzzle to solve, but as a breach in the wall to force closed. They want to **force** the circuit shut to re-arm the shields---empathy be damned.

### The Dean's Secret

[[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Isolde]] has confirmed the "Shattered Circuit" math: the Ash-Blood and [[Mizizi]] Nodes output only Minor Node power despite being Major in size, because they're bleeding energy into the void trying to reach their missing siblings. She refuses to use the brute force methods her family demands.

### Relationship with Zephyr

[[Dean Isolde Vane|The Dean]] has personally invited [[Zephyr]] (the [[Fulgur-Born]]) into the inner circle. Late at night they sketch wind-patterns on chalkboards in the Sky-Spire, eating sunflower seeds. Pure scientific joy---no manipulation.
