# The Ash-Bloods

*Volcanic forge-keepers with hearts of fire*

## What the Players Know

The Ash-Bloods are a clan of humanoid-elemental hybrids who dwell in the volcanic ridges. Their most distinctive feature is their **obsidian skin**—dark, glassy flesh that glows with inner heat. They leave trails of soot and ash wherever they go, and some members literally smolder with flame.

### The Volcanic Homeland

The [[Ash-Blood Isles]] are a chain of volcanic mountains with perpetual smoke and magma flows. The clan lives among the vents and lava tubes, where temperatures would kill most other beings.

### Philosophy: Fire is Ancestor

To the Ash-Bloods, fire is not a tool—it's a **living ancestor** that must be respected and fed. They view Harmony's "Safe-Flame" (chemically stabilized fire) as an insult, a fake substitute for the real thing.

### Integration with Harmony

The Ash-Bloods were the **first successful integration** discovered after 80 years of silence. This happened approximately 24 months ago when Captain Elara Thorne's expedition made contact. Thorne discovered the [[Ash-Blood Isles]] just one week after [[Valerius Sterling Sr.]] had found the [[Mizizi]]---the [[The Power System|Panda line batteries]] (which could store a connection to the land for up to 3 days outside a node) made both discoveries possible.

**What the Integration Brought:**

**To Harmony:**
- Raw obsidian that burns hotter than coal
- Volcanic heat for industrial forges
- A new source of geothermal power
- "Safe Lane" through the Aether storm

**To the Ash-Bloods:**
- Cooling Suits powered by crystal batteries
- Ability to venture into cooler territories
- Access to Harmony's knowledge and tech
- Most importantly: **The volcanoes roared back to life**

### The Resurgence

Since integration, the Ash-Blood youth have experienced something miraculous: their obsidian skin is **brightening** instead of fading. The elders had feared "The Cooling"—a gradual weakening of their fire—but Harmony engineers proved that proximity to other active Nodes **amplifies** Ash-Blood heat.

This has created a generational divide:
- **Elders:** Remember "The Cold Times" and fear outsiders drain their warmth
- **Youth:** Feel the surge of power and want to rush toward the city center

### The Boiler Room

Ash-Bloods aren't forced to work in Vumbua's boiler rooms—they **beg** for the shifts. It's the only place in the Academy hot enough to feel like home without wearing containment suits.

Harmony retrofitted the entire port engine to run on **Direct Obsidian Transfer** instead of generic energy cores. It's 300% more efficient, and the Ash-Bloods take immense pride in being the literal heartbeat of the city.

[[Ignatius]] likely worked these same boilers during construction.

### The Cultural Divide (Session 2)

Integration has split the Ash-Bloods into two ideological camps:

**Traditionalists** (e.g. [[Ignatius]]):
- Fire and volcanic heritage are sacred, non-negotiable
- Ash-Bloods should find new sources of leidian and master their own element
- Harmony's crystal batteries are useful tools, not replacements for true fire
- Ignatius's personal quest: *"I want to find the heart of the volcano"*

**Modernizers** (e.g. [[Ember]]):
- Embrace Harmony's "clean" crystal battery energy
- Refuse to touch organic fire---see it as outdated and dangerous
- View integration as liberation from the harsh volcanic lifestyle
- [[Ember]] (Ignatius's childhood cousin) is excited to never touch fire again

This tension extends beyond personal preference---it's about whether the Ash-Bloods retain their identity or assimilate into Harmony.

### Ash-Blood Physiology ([[session-02|Session 2]])

- Ash-Bloods release heat by **burning hotter** (thermodynamic heat transfer), not sweating
- Their clothing is designed to withstand extreme heat; leidian doesn't burn through it
- They were going through a **"Great Cooling"** (volcanoes dying) before Harmony found them
- Integration revived the heat---but the mechanism isn't fully understood
- Ignatius carries a piece of leidian (obsidian-like heat stone) in his pocket

### Known Ash-Bloods

- **[[Ignatius]]** - Student on a "pilgrimage" to find new heat for his clan (traditionalist)
- **[[Ember]]** - Ignatius's childhood cousin, modernizer who rejects traditional fire
- **[[Lady Ignis]]** - Matriarch, holds highest voting power in Harmony via [[Inverse Power Doctrine]]
- **"The Chad Student"** - Met Ignatius at intake, suspicious of soot
- ~200 Ash-Bloods at the Academy among 70,000 students

### Cultural Notes

- They clean themselves regularly (Ignatius's constant soot is from travel, not culture)
- True Flame (orange, consuming oxygen) is sacred
- Safe-Flame (teal, stable) is considered "fake fire" and shameful
- Physical contact doesn't burn others (despite appearances)
- Ash-Bloods stand out at Academy---mostly wearing black because of soot, skin glowing

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is NOT known to the player characters.

### The Broken Exchange

This year (18 months ago), the Ash-Bloods committed a grave insult to one of the hidden clans.

**What Happened:**
- The Ash-Bloods were scheduled to send a bride to the **[[Trench-Kin]]** in the traditional Exchange
- With their volcanoes reignited by Harmony, they felt they'd "ascended beyond the old ways"
- Instead of sending a person, they dropped an **Obsidian Tablet** down the exchange shaft
- The tablet read: *"The Heat has returned. We need nothing from the Dark. Look to the Light."*

**The Consequences:**
- The [[Trench-Kin]] Elders buried the tablet, fearing curiosity about "the Light"
- One young Trench-Kin named [[Iggy]] found it and read it as an *invitation*
- This is why [[Iggy]] came to the surface—to find out why the Ash-Bloods stopped coming
- The Ash-Bloods don't know they triggered an infiltration

### The "Conductive Theory" (The Real Physics)

The Harmony engineers weren't just being nice—they proved something revolutionary:

**The Discovery:**
Ash-Blood heat isn't a battery that drains; it's a **Resonance Chamber** that amplifies when near other active Nodes.

The more integrated Nodes nearby, the hotter the Ash-Bloods burn. This is why:
- During isolation = slow cooling ("The Cold Times")
- After integration = volcanic resurgence

**What This Means:**
If Harmony successfully integrates all six clans, the Ash-Bloods would burn hotter than they have in **10,000 years**—back to Golden Age levels.

### Lady Ignis and Political Power

**[[Lady Ignis]]** isn't a hostage or a symbolic figurehead. She traveled voluntarily to **[[Harmony Prime]]** (the static capital) to join the High Council as the **Representative of the Clans**.

**Her Power:**
Under Harmony's "Inverse Power Doctrine" (newest members get most political weight to prevent tyranny), she instantly became one of the **most powerful people in the Empire**.

**What She Did:**
- **SHE** signed the "Expansion Bill" authorizing Vumbua's relocation to the Ash-Blood Isles
- She traveled with most of the Ash-Blood Elders fit for travel
- She was escorted by Captain Elara Thorne (who just returned to Vumbua)
- She attempted to bring the [[Mizizi]] Elders too, but they refused

**Her Philosophy:**
"Political integration at the highest level is the only way to ensure my people are partners, not fuel."

She fundamentally believes in Harmony's mission and views integration as **salvation**, not conquest.

### The Energy Reality (The Minimum)

The Ash-Bloods don't know this, but their integration is the **only thing** keeping Harmony from collapsing.

**The Truth:**
- The [[Iron-Union]] can physically feel the "Ghost Charge" (flickering power)
- The Obsidian direct-transfer is the only thing preventing boiler explosions
- Without the Ash-Bloods, Harmony would already be dark
- Each clan integration buys **1-2 years** of power at most

The Ash-Bloods think they joined a thriving empire. In reality, they're **life support** for a dying civilization.

### What the Players Don't Know About Ignatius

**[[Ignatius]]'s Cover Story:**
- He tells people he's on a "pilgrimage" to find new heat for his clan
- The elders say he's "banished" to the trial of adventure

**The Reality:**
Both are true. The elders view leaving as punishment. [[Ignatius]] views it as duty and destiny.

He genuinely believes he will find a "new source of heat" and return a hero. He doesn't understand that **he is the new source**—his clan doesn't need external fire; they need to be part of a larger network.

The irony: The answer he's seeking is integration itself.

### The Shattered Circuit Role

In the six-clan system, the Ash-Bloods represent **POWER** (The Engines):
- [[Mizizi]] (Memory) - The Archivists
- **Ash-Bloods (Power) - The Engines**
- Trench-Kin (Resources) - The Miners
- [[Renali]] (Vision) - The Architects
- [[Wadi]] (Life) - The Sustainers
- Harmony (Direction) - The Navigators

They are the metaphorical (and literal) **furnace** that powers the machine. Without them, nothing else works.

### The Timeline Players Don't Know

- **24 months ago:** First contact and integration
- **18 months ago:** Broke the Exchange (insulted Trench-Kin)
- **12 months ago:** [[Lady Ignis]] left for Harmony Prime
- **6 months ago:** Vumbua relocated to the Isles, construction began
- **Current:** Ash-Blood youth are experiencing a Golden Age they don't understand is temporary
