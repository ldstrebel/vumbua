# Campaign Timeline

## Ancient History

### 3,000 Years Ago - Era 1: The First Spark
- The Weavers and Navigators meet on a dying shard
- First "Stitch" creates Harmony Prime
- [[House Gilded]] builds the first **Chime Spires**---musical resonators that synchronize raw ether into usable power
- For the first 30-50 years, Tesla-like spires on buildings harness ether directly into lights and devices

### 2,500 - 1,500 Years Ago - Era 2: Resource Wars
- Harmony's aggressive expansion causes "Dissolved Lands"
- [[Vane Lineage]] rises to power building defensive walls
- Lesson learned: "One-way flow leads to Dissolution"

### 1,500 - 1,000 Years Ago - Era 3: The Golden Stitch
- [[Scrivener Guild]] decodes Symbiotic Resonance laws
- Golden Age of integration - massive continent growth
- [[Vumbua Academy]] built as first "Teleporting City"

### ~400 Years Ago - The Night of Sparks
- A major node is integrated, causing the [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] to surge from ~350 by over 100 (a 30% increase)
- Without surge protection, the spike overloads every Gilded resonator in Harmony
- Massive fires erupt across the empire; nearly ruins [[House Gilded]]
- **Aftermath:** House Vox develops the first Crystal Batteries using umber crystals from Umbra Mountain
- Vox batteries solve two problems: surge protection (capping power intake) and consistent output
- House Gilded pivots from energy production to banking

### 1,000 - 80 Years Ago - Era 4: The Dwindling
- Great Nodes all integrated, only Minor Nodes remain
- Comfortable stagnation sets in
- Exploranauts become historians instead of adventurers
- [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] gradually rises as nodes accumulate, reaching ~600

---

## The Silent Era (80 Years Ago - Present)

### 80 Years Ago
- **The Drought Begins:** No new Nodes discovered
- Ocean of Aether becomes impassable
- Council sees power reserves dwindling
- "The Minimum" crisis begins (state secret)
- Global Amplitude plateaus at ~600 and begins declining for the first time in recorded history

### 50 Years Ago
- The "Bleached Atoll" incident (island crumbled to dust)
- Proves stagnation leads to destruction

### ~20 Years Ago
- House Vox releases the **Panda line** batteries---current generation
- First battery line capable of storing the connection to the land inside the crystal matrix
- Allows operation up to **3 days outside a node's range** (previous batteries required node proximity)
- Panda line batteries set at 550 amps (below the ~600 Global Amplitude max), car-battery sized, last ~1 year
- This breakthrough enables exploration beyond Harmony's current bounds

### 24 Months Ago - **BREAKTHROUGH**
- **[[valentine-sterling-sr|Valentine Sterling Sr.]]** discovers the [[Mizizi]] one week before Thorne finds the [[Ash-Bloods]]
- Sterling Sr. ("The Paper Man") arrives at the [[Mizizi Petrified Forest|Petrified Forest]] but moves on---integration work bores him
- **Captain Elara Thorne** discovers the [[Ash-Blood Isles]]
- Ash-Bloods accept Cooling Suits (Outward Flow)
- Harmony burns Obsidian (Inward Flow)
- **Integration successful** - volcanoes roar to life
- Safe Lane opens through the Aether storm
- **Anomaly:** Ash-Blood integration produces only ~20 amp increase to Global Amplitude---barely better than a minor node discovered 80 years ago, despite being classified as a major node (expected +300 to +800)

### 18 Months Ago
- **Last Exchange Ritual** occurs
- **[[Zephyr]]** (Storm-Kin) arrives among [[Mizizi]]
  - Unlike disciplined envoys, she openly breaks the Taboo
  - Speaks freely of High-Jet Streams and Thunder-Node
- Ash-Bloods **fail to send bride** to Trench-Kin
  - Drop obsidian tablet: "The Heat has returned. We need nothing from the Dark"
  - Insults the deep dwellers

### 12 Months Ago
- Vumbua begins preparing for relocation
- Largest recruitment drive in history announced
- Previous intake class travels with the Academy ships

### 6 Months Ago
- **[[Vumbua Academy]] relocates** to [[Ash-Blood Isles]]
- Worker-Constructs swarm out to build [[Spire-Scape]]
- Temporary city erected using spare labs and buildings
- [[Iron-Union]] retrofits boiler room for Obsidian direct-transfer
- [[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]] youth beg for boiler room shifts (feels like home)

### 4 Months Ago
- [[Mizizi]] integration attempts begin
- Harmony brings fertilizer/solvents to "help destroy forest"
- **Integration stalls** at 15% - something is wrong
- [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Isolde]] and Historian Nadine begin researching the blockage

### 2 Months Ago
- **[[Rill]] arrives at [[Vumbua Academy]]**
  - **Secretly [[Wadi]] (River Clan):** Originally entered [[Mizizi Petrified Forest|Mizizi Forest]] as an exchange member **6 years ago**.
  - **2 Years Ago:** Left Mizizi forest claiming to study "Accelerated Decay" (The "Traitor" event).
  - **Now:** Actually researching if forest needs to be destroyed at all.
  - Sends letters welcoming other [[Mizizi]] to join her.
- [[Zephyr]] joins [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Vane]]'s inner circle
  - Late night sessions in [[Sky-Spire]] sketching wind-patterns
  - Dean believes she's key to high-altitude flight

## Current Timeline ([[session-00|Session 0]]–[[session-02.5|Session 2.5]])

### Intake Week - Day 1 ([[session-00|Sessions 0]]–[[session-01|1]])
- **100,000 candidates** take the trials
- Largest intake class in [[Vumbua Academy|Vumbua]] history
- [[The Loom]] assigns ranks via typewriter system
- **Party forms:**
  - [[Britt]] & [[Aggie]] ([[Mizizi]] cousins) - suspicious of Harmony
  - [[Ignatius]] ([[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]]) - on pilgrimage for new heat
  - [[Lomi]] (Harmony-born) - boiler room worker
  - [[Iggy]] (disguised [[Trench-Kin]]) - infiltrator seeking answers
- [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Isolde]] welcomes class; [[Rill]] pulls her off stage
- Dorm assignments issued: [[Block 04]] ([[Britt]], [[Aggie]]), [[Block 12]] ([[Iggy]], [[Ignatius]]), [[Block 99]] ([[Lomi]])
- [[Iggy]] climbs crane to "touch the sky"
- [[Lucky]] hustles his first deals (sold [[Iggy]] a stolen turban)

### Intake Week - Night of Day 1 ([[session-02|Session 2]]: The Bonfire)
- **[[Cassius Thorne]]** arranges logs obsessively; [[Lomi]] encouraged him with a critical-success roll
- **[[Serra Vox]]** approaches [[Britt]]/[[Aggie]]; slips about political connections to [[Harmony Prime|The Seat]]
- **The Speculators' Debate:** [[Percival Vane-Smythe III|Percy]] argues the Sixfold Theory; [[Iron-Jaw Jax|Jax]] dismisses it; [[Bramble]] asks *"What if we are the ones who forgot?"*
- Serra explains the **[[Inverse Power Doctrine]]** to [[Ignatius]] ([[Lady Ignis]] holds highest voting power)
- Cultural exchange: [[Mizizi]] view death as natural ("Congratulations!"); Harmony fears death
- Serra reveals the [[Mizizi Petrified Forest|Mizizi forest]] has no clear "purpose"---unusual among nodes
- [[Lomi]] brings **Engine Grease** (moonshine); [[Zephyr]] drinks it
- **[[Zephyr]]'s Lightning:** Purple bolt from clear sky strikes her; she's unharmed *(Scene 4: The Lightning)*
- **[[Rill]]** appears, retrieves [[Zephyr]], invites [[Britt]]/[[Aggie]] to find her after class (grass-covered building)
- [[Ignatius]] reveals [[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]] cultural divide: traditionalists (himself) vs modernizers ([[Ember]])
- Leidian properties discussed: 80% hotter, halflife oscillation, distance decay
- Party heads to the **[[Celestial Lounge]]** for a nightcap

### Intake Week - Night of Day 1 ([[session-02.5|Session 2.5]]: The Power Room)
- While others are at bonfire, [[Iggy]] Irish-goodbyes and sneaks into the [[Walker-Core]] power plant
- Meets [[Tommy]] (gnome clerk) and [[Lucina]] (dwarf mechanic) in the lobby — neither stops him
- Discovers over-engineered [[The Power System|Panda 5 resonator batteries]] and charts showing [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] decline
- **[[Professor Kante]]** appears — has been watching [[Iggy]] sketch; impressed by his technical intuition
- Kante explains [[The Minimum]] crisis: amplitude declining 30-40 years, [[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]] surge only produced ~20 amps (expected +300 to +800)
- Kante's theory: integration works through cultural connection, not resource extraction
- [[Iggy]] mentions "the Exchange" — Kante has never heard of it
- Kante gives [[Iggy]] an **umber crystal** and invites him to return as a collaborator
- [[Iggy]] designs five experiments to test "connection" — rejoins group for [[Celestial Lounge]]
