## The Setting

**The Great Stitching** is a process where isolated civilizations and their reality-Nodes are physically integrated into a growing empire called **Harmony**. [[Vumbua Academy]] is a mobile city-state that has just relocated to a new frontier after 80 years of stagnation.

Our party of five unlikely students must navigate:
- Political intrigue between Harmony's houses
- Cultural tensions with newly integrated clans
- The mystery of why integration sometimes fails
- Personal quests for identity, power, and truth

### The Party

### Documentation Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Updated |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Lore vault** (`lore/`) | Single source of truth for all campaign content | After each session via AI workflows |
| **NotebookLM exports** (`meta/docs/notebooklm/`) | Consolidated copies for NotebookLM ingestion | Manually re-exported after major updates |
| **Legacy docs** (`meta/legacy/`) | Original pre-migration source material | Not actively maintained |
| **AI reference** (`.agent/workflows/lore-index.md`) | Quick reference for AI session processing | After each session |

## Dual-Track Documentation

Lore pages include both **player-facing information** and **GM narration** (not "secrets" — this is narrated content from real-play sessions):

- **"What Players Know"** sections are safe to share
- **"GM Narration"** sections contain unrevealed DM content, marked with caution boxes
- The [[Knowledge Tracker]] tracks what's been revealed

### Truth tiers (reduces RAG confusion)
To prevent planned content from masquerading as session-truth, we treat information as one of:
- **transcript**: said/seen in-session (highest confidence)
- **gm-narration**: narrated by GM but not yet known to PCs (still canon, but hidden)
- **gm-plan**: prep/rosters/intent (not yet occurred in-session)

If something is `gm-plan` (e.g. a squad roster before the Loom selection happens), it must be clearly labeled and kept out of player-facing sections.

---

## Content Guidelines

### Session Recaps
- **Keep ALL story-relevant dialogue** — zero detail loss
- **Screenplay format** with speaker attribution (character name for IC, player name for OOC)
- **Scene-by-scene structure** for easy reference
- **Only correct 99%-confidence transcription errors** — never summarize or embellish
- See `.agent/workflows/add-session.md` for full rules

### Lore & Character Pages
- **Never hallucinate** — only record information from session transcripts or GM narration
- **Dual-track format**: "What Players Know" + "GM Narration"
- **Link between related pages** and update the Knowledge Tracker
- See `.agent/workflows/add-lore.md` and `.agent/workflows/add-character.md`

## Update Dependencies

When completing any task, the AI must update all downstream files. Use this as a checklist:

| After... | Always update... |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Processing a session** | `lore/knowledge-tracker.md`, `lore/timeline.md`, `.agent/workflows/lore-index.md` (session delta + session status), `CHANGELOG.md` |
| **Adding/updating a character** | `lore/characters/index.md`, `.agent/workflows/lore-index.md` (NPC list + spellings), `CHANGELOG.md` |
| **Adding/updating lore** | `lore/index.md`, `lore/glossary.md` (if new terms), `.agent/workflows/lore-index.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` |
| **Any AI action** | `CHANGELOG.md` — date-stamped bullet with TLDR + file(s) changed |

---

## Changelog

All AI-driven changes are logged in [[Changelog|`CHANGELOG.md`]] with date stamps. Every workflow appends to this file upon completion.

---

## Deployment

Deploy changes via the `/deploy` workflow or manually:

```bash
git add lore/
git commit -m "Session XX recap and lore updates"
git push origin main
```
