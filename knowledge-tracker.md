# Knowledge Tracker

> **Purpose:** Track what players know vs. GM secrets still hidden

## The Mizizi Forest

### What Players Know
- ✅ The forest is petrified/stone
- ✅ Harmony is helping them destroy it with solvents and tools
- ✅ The [[mizizi|Mizizi]] philosophy: "When things stop dying, we start dying"
- ✅ [[rill|Rill]] left the forest 2 years ago to research at [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]]
- ✅ The forest doesn't have a clear "purpose" like other nodes---this puzzles Harmony scholars ([[session-02|Session 2]])
- ✅ There's a problem: "too much life"---things aren't dying properly ([[session-02|Session 2]])
- ✅ [[mizizi|Mizizi]] view death as natural and celebrate the cycle; Harmony culture fears death ([[session-02|Session 2]])
- ✅ The Mizizi have NOT been formally integrated---no seat at Harmony, just a "semi-short-term weapons trade" ([[session-02|Session 2]])

### GM Secrets (Players Don't Know)
- ❌ The forest is a **data archive/library**
- ❌ The trees are biological hard drives storing Imperial history
- ❌ Destroying it erases thousands of years of knowledge
- ❌ The "new growth" represents hardy archive fragments
- ❌ Integration requires Mizizi bark to be turned into paper filled with knowledge

---

## The Power Crisis

### What Players Know
- ✅ [[Vumbua Academy|Vumbua]] has "flickering lights" occasionally (might not have noticed)
- ✅ The Academy relocated recently to the [[ash-blood-isles|Ash-Blood Isles]]
- ✅ Leidian is burning 80% hotter per gram in the last 2 years since integration ([[session-02|Session 2]])
- ✅ Leidian has a halflife oscillation---heat tapers then rises again ([[session-02|Session 2]])
- ✅ Leidian loses some potency with distance from [[Ash-Blood Isles|Ash-Blood isle]] ([[session-02|Session 2]])
- ✅ The boiler room uses both crystal batteries and leidian ([[session-02|Session 2]])
- 
### Iggy Only ([[session-02.5|Session 2.5]] — via [[Professor Kante]])
- 🔶 [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] measures total ether energy across Harmony — increases with each node integration
- 🔶 The Global Amplitude has been declining for 30-40 years (first decline in recorded history)
- 🔶 The Ash-Blood integration only produced ~20 amp increase instead of expected +300 to +800
- 🔶 House Vox scrapped the Apex 1 battery line (Kante's next-gen battery is useless)
- 🔶 [[professor-kante|Professor Kante]] is investigating the [[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]] Anomaly — invited [[iggy|Iggy]] to collaborate
- 🔶 The Night of Sparks (~400 years ago) burned the world for two months before umber crystals existed
- 🔶 Crystal batteries (Panda 5) are surge regulators/receptors, not storage — powered by umber crystals
- 🔶 Integration works through cultural connection between peoples — not resource extraction
- 🔶 Iggy now possesses an umber crystal given by Kante

### GM Secrets (Players Don't Know)
- ❌ "The Minimum" crisis has a name (Iggy understands the concept but hasn't heard the term)
- ❌ Harmony is running out of power (Iggy senses this but doesn't know the full scope)
- ❌ The Panda line batteries (550 amps) are approaching failure threshold (specific number not shared)
- ❌ House Gilded built the original resonators; House Vox built the crystal batteries (partial — Kante mentioned his family and the Guild)
- ❌ This is why the massive intake happened
- ❌ If they fail, the lights go out forever
- ❌ Even discussing power levels is taboo (Kante spoke freely, but he may be breaking protocol)

## Iggy's Origin

### What Players Know
- ✅ [[iggy|Iggy]] is "[[Trench-Kin|Earthkin]]"

## Integration Mechanics

### What Players Know
- ✅ Harmony "integrates" clans somehow
- ✅ The [[ash-bloods|Ash-Bloods]] are successfully integrated (volcanoes roaring)
- ✅ The [[mizizi|Mizizi]] integration is "incomplete" or "stalled"

### GM Secrets (Players Don't Know)
- ❌ Integration requires **two-way energy flow** (Inward + Outward)
- ❌ The "Shattered Circuit" theory - all six clans must be integrated
- ❌ Each individual integration only buys 1-2 years of power
- ❌ Completing the circuit = 500-year Golden Age
- ❌ The "Safe Lane" phenomenon (calm corridors through Aether storms)

- ✅ [[ash-bloods|Ash-Bloods]] release heat by burning hotter, not sweating (Session 2)
- ✅ Ash-Bloods were going through a "Great Cooling" before Harmony found them (Session 2)
- ✅ Cultural divide: traditionalists ([[ignatius|Ignatius]]) vs modernizers ([[ember|Ember]]) on fire vs batteries (Session 2)

### GM Secrets (Players Don't Know)
- ❌ The clans are **specialized castes** of one ancient civilization
- ❌ The "Shattered Empire" fell 10,000 years ago
- ❌ There are exactly six clans needed:
  - Mizizi (Memory)
  - Ash-Bloods (Power)
  - Trench-Kin (Resources)
  - Renali/Storm-Kin (Vision)
  - Wadi (Life)
  - Plus Harmony (Direction)
- ❌ Separation caused the Shattering, not proximity

---

- ❌ The Loom calculates "Savant" flags based on variance

---

## Harmony Governance

### What Players Know
- ✅ The **[[Inverse Power Doctrine]]**: newest integrated member gets highest voting power ([[session-02|Session 2]])
- ✅ [[lady-ignis|Lady Ignis]] is essentially "President" of Harmony because of this rule ([[session-02|Session 2]])
- ✅ *"The least of us should become the most of us"* ([[session-02|Session 2]])
- ✅ This prevents exploitation of new members' resources ([[session-02|Session 2]])
- ✅ It's kept the peace for a thousand years ([[session-02|Session 2]])
- ✅ [[Harmony Prime|Harmony Seat]] has ~8 million people ([[session-02|Session 2]])

### GM Secrets (Players Don't Know)
