## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### Clan Lore (Ash-Blood / Ignatius): "Smoke-Stalkers"

They do not hunt heat; they hunt **fear**. They are physical manifestations of the void trying to reclaim reality.

**Running triggers their chase instinct.** You must stand perfectly still and hold a "True Flame" (not Safe-Flame). They cannot cross a circle of real fire.

### Recent Incident

A patrol of "The Breakers" (Squad 02) engaged a pack last night using floodlights. Two guards were dragged into the dark; their screams simply stopped instantly.
