# The Dual-Codex: Harmony vs. The Wilds

The Academy views the frontier as a resource to be harvested. The Clans view it as a living entity to be negotiated with.

**Mechanic:** Players can roll **Knowledge (Academic)** to get the Harmony entry, or **Knowledge (Culture/Nature)** to get the Clan entry. Usually, the Clan entry contains the *actual* solution to the encounter.
