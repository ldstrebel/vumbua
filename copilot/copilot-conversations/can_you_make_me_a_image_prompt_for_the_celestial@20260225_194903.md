**ai**: Based on the details of [[vumbua-academy]], here is a detailed image prompt designed to capture that "1920s Oxford meets *Treasure Planet*" aesthetic for the Celestial Lounge establishing shot:

**Prompt:**
- **Subject:** A breathtaking cinematic establishing shot from the first-person perspective of students stepping into the opulent Celestial Lounge.
- **Foreground:** The interior of the lounge features polished mahogany floors, brass Art Deco railings, and plush teal velvet furniture. The silhouettes of students are visible in the lower frame, looking out in awe.
- **Midground:** Massive, floor-to-ceiling panoramic windows reveal the "Spire-Scape." Below, a dense cluster of 1920s Oxford-style stone masonry buildings and Gothic spires are intertwined with massive brass steam cranes and modular scaffolding. Glowing teal ley-lines pulse through the streets like veins of energy.
- **Background:** To the left, the [[Sky-Spire]] towers above the skyline—a vertical, golden airship balloon glowing with internal light. To the right, in the far distance, the soot-stained iron silhouette of the [[Deep-Hull]] base is visible, its massive steam stacks venting glowing teal exhaust into the twilight sky.
- **Atmosphere & Lighting:** Golden hour lighting with a hazy, "exploration fever" atmosphere. Volumetric lighting, brass reflections, and a mix of Victorian elegance and high-tech industrialism.
- **Style:** Hyper-realistic, 8k resolution, *Treasure Planet* and *Arcane* inspired concept art, cinematic wide-angle lens.

***

### Key Elements Included from your Vault:
- **The Aesthetic:** The contrast between the stone masonry of "Oxford" and the brass/teal energy of the Academy.
- **The Cores:** Clear visual distinction between the golden [[Sky-Spire]] and the industrial [[Deep-Hull]].
- **The Spire-Scape:** The presence of cranes and scaffolding to show the city is still being assembled.
- **Harmony Magic:** The teal glow of the ley-lines and steam, representing the "Safe" geometric magic of the Academy.

**ai**: Here is the updated image prompt, shifting the atmosphere to a nighttime "steampunk-noir" aesthetic with the specific structural changes you requested:

**Prompt:**
- **Subject:** A cinematic nighttime establishing shot from the first-person perspective of students entering the top-floor Celestial Lounge.
- **Foreground:** The interior is bathed in warm, low-light amber. Polished dark mahogany floors and ornate brass Art Deco fixtures. The silhouettes of students stand at the edge of the frame, looking out through massive, floor-to-ceiling panoramic windows.
- **Midground:** The "Spire-Scape" at night. A sprawling vista of 1920s Oxford-style stone buildings and Gothic spires, illuminated by warm streetlamps and the orange glow of construction fires. Dark iron cranes and wooden scaffolding create a dense, industrial silhouette against the city.
- **Background (Left):** The [[Sky-Spire]] looms—not as a round balloon, but as a massive, vertical golden zeppelin with a rigid, elongated metallic hull. It is tethered to the city, glowing with internal amber light and portholes.
- **Background (Right):** In the far distance, the heavy iron silhouette of the [[Deep-Hull]] base. Its massive steam stacks vent thick plumes of steam, caught in the orange under-light of the city’s furnaces.
- **Atmosphere & Lighting:** Midnight setting. **No blue or teal highlights.** The color palette is dominated by deep blacks, brassy golds, and fiery ambers. High-contrast lighting with a "steampunk-noir" feel.
- **Style:** Hyper-realistic, 8k resolution, *Treasure Planet* meets *BioShock* aesthetic, cinematic wide-angle lens, volumetric orange steam.

***

### Key Adjustments Made:
- **Time of Day:** Shifted to night, using amber and gold as the primary light sources instead of daylight.
- **Color Palette:** Removed all teal/blue energy signatures, replacing them with the warm glow of brass, lamps, and furnace fire.
- **The [[Sky-Spire]]:** Redesigned from a hot air balloon to a vertical, rigid-hull zeppelin to give it a more industrial, "heavy" feel.
- **The [[Deep-Hull]]:** Emphasized the orange-lit steam to make it feel like a massive, working engine in the dark.

**user**: what can you do in a rest short and long in daggerheart {meta/Daggerheart-Core}
[Context: Notes: sessions/planning/Session 3 Plan.md]

**ai**: In Daggerheart, rests are the primary way for your characters to recover resources and prepare for the challenges ahead. Based on the standard rules and your [[Session 3 Plan]], here is how they function:

### Short Rest
A Short Rest typically takes about 10–30 minutes in-fiction. It is a quick breather to patch up wounds and steady your nerves.

- **Clear Stress:** You can spend 1 Hope to clear 1 Stress. You can do this as many times as you have Hope available.
- **Rest Actions:** You can choose **two** of the following actions (you cannot pick the same one twice):
- **Tend to Wounds:** Roll an Instinct Check (Difficulty 10). On a success, heal 1d6 HP.
- **Repair Armor:** Roll a Knowledge Check (Difficulty 10). On a success, clear all marked Armor slots.
- **Blow off Steam:** Roll a Presence Check (Difficulty 10). On a success, clear 1d6 Stress without spending Hope.
- **Bond:** Roleplay a short scene or conversation with another character. Both of you gain 1 Hope.

### Long Rest
A Long Rest requires a safe location (like your dorms in [[Block 12]] or [[Block 04]]) and a full night's sleep. As noted in your [[Session 3 Plan]], this is the transition point before the "Morning After" events.

- **Full Recovery:** You automatically clear all marked Stress, all marked Armor slots, and heal all HP to maximum.
- **Hope Refresh:** Your Hope resets to its starting value (usually 2) if it was lower. If you had more than 2 Hope, you keep your current total.
- **Level Up:** If the GM has awarded a level, the Long Rest is when you officially apply your new stats, abilities, and multiclass/subclass choices.
- **Class Selection:** In your specific campaign context, the Long Rest after the ambush is the narrative trigger for the **Track Assignment** (choosing your Daggerheart class/subclass).

### GM Note on your [[Session 3 Plan]]
In Phase 1 (The Celestial Lounge), you mentioned that if players stay out too late, they should start marking **Stress**. If they enter the **Ambush** with high Stress and then take a **Long Rest** immediately after, they will start the "Morning After" fully refreshed. However, if they choose to stay up and investigate Azor instead of resting, they would forgo these benefits, making the **Track Assignment** and the **Resonance Race** much more difficult.
