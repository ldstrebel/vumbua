**ai**: I can help you create an index of your NPCs.

Could you please clarify what you mean by "feel like"? Are you referring to their personality traits, their general demeanor, or a specific property you use in your notes to describe them?

For example, for [[Baron Bolt]], I could list his personality as "Impulsive and showy." If you have other NPCs, I can help you compile a table with their names and their respective "feel like" descriptions once you provide more context or examples.

**user**: Sorry I typod. I want to build an index of the NPCs grouped in a useful way with obsidian links ready

**ai**: No problem at all! I understand you want an index of your NPCs, grouped logically, with Obsidian links.

To create a useful index, we need to decide on a grouping method. Based on the information in [[Baron Bolt]], here are a few ways we could group your NPCs:

1.  **By Affiliation:** Grouping by organizations or factions they belong to (e.g., [[Vumbua Academy]]).
2.  **By Squad/Team:** Grouping by specific teams or squads (e.g., Squad 08).
3.  **By Status:** Grouping by their current status (e.g., Active, Deceased, Retired).
4.  **By Tags:** If you use specific tags for different types of NPCs (e.g., `squad-08`).
5.  **By Role:** Grouping by their position or function (e.g., Member, Captain).

Which of these grouping methods would be most useful for you? Or do you have another way you'd like to group them?

Once you tell me your preferred grouping, I can help you build that index. For example, if we were to group by **Squad/Team** using the current context, it might look something like this:

**Squad 08 (The Legacy)**
- [[Baron Bolt]]
- [[Lady Glimmer]]
- [[Percival Vane-Smythe III]]

**user**: Sure we can do squds, factions, etc and maybe tag them with sessions they were in?

**ai**: Okay, that's a great approach! Grouping by squads, factions, and potentially tagging with sessions will create a very rich and useful index.

Currently, I only have detailed information for [[Baron Bolt]]. To build a comprehensive index with these groupings, I'll need to know about your other NPC notes.

Regarding "sessions they were in," how do you typically track this information in your NPC notes? Do you use:
-   A specific tag (e.g., `#session-01`)?
-   A property (e.g., `sessions: [[Session 1]], [[Session 5]]`)?
-   Or something else entirely?

Once I have more NPC data and understand how you track sessions, I can generate an index that looks something like this (this is just an example structure, we can refine it):

```
# NPC Index

## By Squad/Team

### Squad 08 (The Legacy)
- [[Baron Bolt]] (Affiliation: [[Vumbua Academy]]) (Sessions: #session-01, #session-05)
- [[Lady Glimmer]] (Affiliation: [[Vumbua Academy]]) (Sessions: #session-01)
- [[Percival Vane-Smythe III]] (Affiliation: [[Vumbua Academy]]) (Sessions: #session-01)

## By Affiliation/Faction

### Vumbua Academy
- [[Baron Bolt]] (Squad: Squad 08) (Sessions: #session-01, #session-05)
- [[Lady Glimmer]] (Squad: Squad 08) (Sessions: #session-01)
- [[Percival Vane-Smythe III]] (Squad: Squad 08) (Sessions: #session-01)

...and so on for other squads and factions.
```

Please provide more of your NPC notes or tell me how you'd like me to search your vault for them, and how you track session information!

**user**: They are in the NPC directory can you read that?
[Timestamp: 2026/02/17 23:56:47]

**ai**: I understand you have your NPC notes organized in an "NPC directory."

To help me read them, could you please either:

1.  **Provide the content of those NPC notes directly?** You can copy and paste them into our chat.
2.  **Instruct me to search your vault for them?** For example, you could say something like: "@vault search for notes in the 'NPC directory' folder" or "@vault find all notes with the tag #npc".

Once I have access to the content of your other NPC notes, I can extract the squad, faction, and session information to build the comprehensive index you're looking for.

Also, please remind me how you track the "sessions they were in" within those notes (e.g., a specific tag like `#session-01`, a property like `sessions: [[Session 1]]`, etc.).

**user**: I'm referring that folder in this chat
[Timestamp: 2026/02/17 23:57:43]

**ai**: Thank you for clarifying! I understand that "NPC directory" refers to the folder containing your NPC notes.

To "read" the notes within that directory, I need you to use the `@vault` command to search for them. For example, you could say:

`@vault search for notes in the 'lore/characters/npcs' folder` (assuming 'lore/characters/npcs' is the path to your NPC directory, based on [[baron-bolt]]'s path).

Once you provide the search results, I'll be able to extract the necessary information (squads, factions, etc.) from all your NPCs.

Also, please confirm how you track the "sessions they were in" within those notes. Is it a tag like `#session-01`, a property like `sessions: [[Session 1]]`, or something else? This detail is important for including it in the index.
