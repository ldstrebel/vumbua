**ai**: Based on the provided context from [[Session 3 Plan]], the specific academic exam questions for the [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua Academy]] are not explicitly listed in the text. However, here is what is mentioned regarding the exams and "questions" for the session:

### 1. The Exam Answer Packets
The note mentions that [[Lucky]] has been selling **test answer packets**. 
- [[valentine-sterling|Valentine Sterling]] bought one out of curiosity.
- He found them to be a "decent estimation" of the real exam but noted there were **flaws in the answers**.

### 2. "Truths & Treachery" Statements
If you are looking for the "questions" or prompts used during the social game at the [[celestial-lounge|Celestial Lounge]], these are set up as statements that players must guess are True or False:

**[[ember|Ember]]'s Statements:**
- *"The clean fire of Harmony — the crystal energy — it feels more alive to me than the heat of the volcano ever did. The first time I held a battery, I felt... home."* (**TRUTH**)

**[[valentine-sterling|Valentine]]'s Statements:**
- The table for Valentine's statements is mentioned but the specific text for his first statement is partially cut off in the summary.

### 3. Missing Information
The actual academic questions (e.g., for a Lore or Harmony exam) might be located in one of the **15 omitted sections** of the planning document or in a separate note. 

If you have a specific note dedicated to the exams, you can try searching for it by typing **@vault** followed by "exam questions" so I can look through your other files!
