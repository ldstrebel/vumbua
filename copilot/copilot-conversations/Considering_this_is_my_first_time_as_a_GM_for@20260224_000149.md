**user**: Considering this is my first time as a GM for a dagger heart combat in session 3. Can you pull from the daggerhart core rules? Any references that I will need to be able to run that combat effectively almost as a tutorial for our players who also haven't had dagger heart before. We know D&D 5e pretty well

**ai**: Since you and your players are coming from D&D 5e, the biggest shift in **Daggerheart** isn't the math—it's the **flow of the spotlight**. In 5e, combat is a rigid cycle of turns. In Daggerheart, it’s a conversation.

Here is a "Tutorial Guide" for running **The Ambush** in Session 3, pulling from the core mechanics to help your 5e players transition smoothly.

---

### 1. The "No-Turn" Initiative (The Action Tracker)
In 5e, you roll initiative and wait your turn. In Daggerheart, there are no turns.
- **How to run it:** Tell your players: *"You guys act in whatever order makes sense for the story. If Ignatius wants to charge in, he goes first. If Iggy wants to follow up with a spell, he goes next."*
- **The Action Tracker:** Every time a player makes an **Action Roll** (2d12 + modifiers), they place a token (a d6 or a coin) in the center of the table. 
- **When do you (the GM) go?** You don't wait. You take over the spotlight when:
    1. A player rolls a **Failure** (Total < Difficulty).
    2. A player rolls a **Success with Fear** (Hope die < Fear die).
- **The GM's Turn:** When you take over, you spend the tokens the players accumulated to activate your NPCs. One token = one NPC action.

### 2. The Roll: Hope vs. Fear
Instead of a d20, players roll **2d12** (one Hope die, one Fear die).
- **Success with Hope (Hope > Fear):** They succeed and gain a **Hope Token**. (Tutorial tip: Remind them they can spend Hope to help allies or use special abilities).
- **Success with Fear (Fear > Hope):** They succeed, but **you gain a Fear Token** or make a "GM Move." In 5e terms, this is a "Success at a Cost."
- **Critical Success (Doubles):** If they roll the same number on both dice, it’s a Crit. They clear all Stress, succeed brilliantly, and deal extra damage.

### 3. Damage Thresholds (The "5e Brain" Hurdle)
This is the hardest part for 5e players. In 5e, 10 damage is just 10 HP gone. In Daggerheart, damage is categorized by **Thresholds**.
- **Look at the Character Sheet:** They have three numbers (e.g., 4 / 10 / 16).
- **Minor (Below first number):** 1 HP damage.
- **Major (Between 1st and 2nd):** 2 HP damage.
- **Severe (Above 3rd):** 3 HP damage.
- **Tutorial Tip:** When Tus hits a player for 2 physical damage, and their Minor threshold is 4, they take **0 HP damage** but might take a **Stress** instead.

### 4. Armor and Stress
In 5e, Armor (AC) makes you harder to hit. In Daggerheart, **Difficulty** is how hard you are to hit, and **Armor** is how you soak damage.
- **Spending Armor:** If a player is about to take 2 HP damage, they can "spend" an Armor Slot to roll their Armor Die and subtract it from the incoming damage. This might drop the damage from "Major" to "Minor," saving them an HP.
- **Stress:** Stress is a resource. Players can spend it to add +2 to a roll (Pushing Yourself). If they take damage that doesn't meet a threshold, you can tell them to mark a Stress instead.

### 5. Range Bands (No Grids)
Daggerheart uses five range bands instead of feet:
- **Melee:** Within arm's reach.
- **Close:** Within a few steps (a small room).
- **Near:** A short sprint (a hallway).
- **Far:** A long distance (across a courtyard).
- **Very Far:** The edge of sight.
- **Tutorial Tip:** During the ambush, tell the players: *"Tus and Zyykl are at **Close** range. They can move into **Melee** and attack in one action."*

### Running "The Ambush" as a Tutorial

Use the NPCs to teach specific mechanics:

**Round 1: The Action Roll & Fear**
- Have a player roll to spot the ambush (**Instinct**). 
- If they roll a **Success with Fear**, say: *"You see the glint of a blade just in time to dodge, but the silence of the Nstyl brothers is unnerving. I'm taking a Fear token."*

**Round 2: Teaching "Group Attacks"**
- Use **Tus & Zyykl's Group Attack**. 
- Explain: *"Because they are Nstyl brothers, they communicate with hand signals. I'm spending a Fear token to have all three of them strike at once. This is one big attack roll against you."*

**Round 3: Teaching "Slippery" & Reactions**
- When a player hits **Azor**, use his **Slippery** reaction.
- Explain: *"You land a solid blow, but Azor is a street-rat from Settika. He marks a Stress to immediately disengage and move to Far range. He's not going to stand and trade blows like a 5e Fighter."*

**Round 4: The Moral Choice (Stress)**
- If the players are winning, have the Nstyl brothers look visibly confused/scared (since they were tricked). 
- Tell the players: *"You can try to talk them down, but it'll cost you. Make a Presence roll. You can mark a **Stress** to add +2 to the roll if you really want to convince them you aren't the enemy."*

### Summary Checklist for the GM Table:
- [ ] **Action Tracker:** A bowl or paper to hold tokens.
- [ ] **Fear Pool:** Start with 2 Fear tokens.
- [ ] **Difficulty:** Most checks in this fight should be **Difficulty 13** (Azor) or **Difficulty 9** (Tus/Zyykl).
- [ ] **Remind Players:** "You don't have a turn. Just tell me what you do!"
