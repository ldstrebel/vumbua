## Appearance

An Ember Islander with **literal flames**—covered in soot with fire as a natural part of his being. When asked what gave away his origin, the answer was obvious: "Was it the soot or the literal flames?"

## Personality

Ignatius carries a **facade of confidence** that can melt away when confronted with the overwhelming reality of Harmony's scale. He's politically minded for a teenager—passionate about his clan's independence but without full understanding of how the world works.

**Key Traits:**
- Idealistic about Ash Blood independence
- Views Harmony relationship as a partnership, not subservience
- Culturally proud—almost Hawaiian in sentiment
- "Classic teenager with strong political ideals who doesn't really know how the world works"

## Background

From the Ember Isles, Ignatius witnessed the integration ceremony that brought the Ash Bloods into Harmony as full citizens. He watched as Lady Ignis—his clan's matriarch—rose to sudden prominence.

### The Integration Ceremony
Ignatius attended the **Stitching ceremony** where:
- An obsidian cooking stone and Harmony battery cooked meat side by side
- When they took the first bite, the volcano came alive
- Lady Ignis gained enormous status and resources (airship, sea vessel, iron walker)
- The Ash Bloods became quasi-famous in Harmony

### What He Knows
- Lady Ignis is now someone extremely important in Harmony
- The volcano's reaction to the Integration was significant
- Captain Aara Thorne discovered the Ash Blood islands
- The relationship should be a "partnership" not exploitation

### What He Questions
- Why did the elders leave?
- Why is this integration such a big deal for Harmony?
- Is the clan being taken advantage of?
