# Iggy

> *"Where am I?"*

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Origin** | Unknown (possibly Trench-Kin) |
| **Rank** | TBD (receipt was... used as a tissue) |
| **Class** | Daggerheart Character |
| **Player** | Holly |

## Appearance

Iggy has a **slimy** quality—enough that when he reached into the receipt printer, the attendant recoiled: "It's already gross. Oh, it's so gross." His physiology produces mucus or slime.

## Personality

Iggy is **bewildered, curious, and unconventional**. He navigates the world with a child-like wonder that sometimes causes chaos—like destroying a testing cubicle's throughput by using the receipt paper as a tissue.

**Key Traits:**
- Constantly confused about his surroundings
- Curious to the point of causing problems
- "If you have a god, please pray" - what attendants say after meeting him
- Physically unusual enough to require supervisor intervention

## Background

Iggy's origins are deliberately mysterious. He may be connected to the **Trench-Kin**—an uncontacted clan that players don't yet know about.

### What He Doesn't Know
- Basically everything about how civilization works
- What a receipt is
- Where he is

- Harmony may not even realize what they've let into the academy
- His "innocence" could be a mask or genuine naivety
