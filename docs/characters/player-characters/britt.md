## Appearance

A turtle-mushroom hybrid of the Mizizi clan—a mixture of sturdy shell and fungal growths. The Mizizi physiology includes moss, shell, and mycelia as natural features.

## Personality

Britt is **sure-footed and observant**. Where her clanmate Aggie might be swept along by the crowd, Britt holds her own—throwing elbows when necessary to push through. She's protective of those close to her and quick to think on her feet.

**Key Traits:**
- Resourceful under pressure
- Protective of Aggie
- Observant of her surroundings
- Willing to bend rules when needed (held down her test flag to wait for Aggie)

## Background

Born in the Petrified Forest of the Mizizi homeland, Britt grew up with the clan's unique philosophy on death and decay. When Harmony arrived and began working with the elders, Britt was among those selected to attend Vumbua Academy.

### What She Knows
- The forest has been "not dying" which is deeply concerning to her people

### Suspicions

- Potentially suspicious of Harmony's true motives
- More aggressive in her questioning than Aggie
