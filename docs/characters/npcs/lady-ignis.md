## Rise to Power

Before Contact, Lady Ignis was the respected matriarch of the Ash Blood clan. After the **Integration Ceremony**, she became overnight one of the most powerful people in Harmony.

### The Integration Ceremony

The pivotal moment that changed everything:
1. An obsidian cooking stone (traditional) and a Harmony battery (technological) cooked meat side by side
2. When they took the first bite together, **the volcano came alive**
3. The Ash Bloods were formally integrated as full Harmony citizens
4. Lady Ignis gained immediate status and resources

### What She Received
- Attendants and staff
- A personal airship
- A sea vessel
- An iron walker
- "Anything she wanted came"

## Her Promise

Before leaving with Captain Aara Thorne, she addressed her clan:

> *"I'm going to make sure that we are respected."*

Whatever else she said, not everyone caught it—but this was her public vow.

## Current Status

Lady Ignis departed on her new airship, escorted by Captain Thorne, to destinations unknown in the east. The Ash Bloods now have quasi-celebrity status throughout Harmony.
