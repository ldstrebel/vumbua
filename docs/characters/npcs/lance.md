# Lance

> *"It's hard to wipe off. I mean, it's something that never leaves you."*

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Origin** | Harmony (established family) |
| **Rank** | TBD |
| **Affiliation** | Student - Vumbua Academy |

## Appearance

Tall, nicely dressed—**Bridgerton meets rugby player**. Blonde, quintessentially "Chad Oxford." Well-groomed with fine clothing that signals established Harmony citizenship.

## Personality

Lance tries to be polite about cultural differences, but his privileged background shows through. He's curious about the new clans but struggles to mask his mild discomfort around non-Harmony physiology.

**Notable Quotes:**
- "Don't worry, Chad. Welcome to the show, mate."
- "I mean, you are on fire, lad."
- "I hope I hope not, actually." (when Ignatius said he'd get used to the fire)

## Session Appearances

### Session 1
- Approached Ignatius after the entrance exam
- Attempted to be welcoming but came across as awkward
- Referred to the Ash Blood islands as "that's what you called them"
- Made polite excuses and left quickly

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ignatius** | First contact—awkward but notable |

## GM Notes

> [!NOTE]
> Lance could be a recurring presence—a well-meaning but oblivious representative of Harmony privilege. Useful for showing cultural friction.
