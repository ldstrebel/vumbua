# Rill

> *"I'm on the hunt for answers of why we are the way we are."*

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Origin** | Exchange (arrived at Mizizi 2 years ago) |
| **Current Location** | Left Mizizi, searching for answers |
| **Affiliation** | Independent researcher |

## Background

Rill arrived in the [[Mizizi]] homeland as part of an exchange program two years ago. She was **clearly not a turtle-mushroom** and stuck out immediately. Unlike those who adapted to the Mizizi way of life, Rill was visibly unhappy there.

### Her Journey
1. Arrived at Mizizi forest 2 years ago via exchange
2. Never fit in—always seemed depressed
3. Left the forest when Harmony's second wave arrived
4. One of the first people to leave the Mizizi forest
5. Sent letters back promising to find answers

## What She's Searching For

> "Why we are the way we are."

Rill is investigating the fundamental nature of the clans—why they are different, why they have unique abilities, and what connects them.

## Letters to the Clan

She has written back to the [[Mizizi]], inviting anyone who leaves to come find her. This creates a potential connection point for [[Aggie]] and [[Britt]].
