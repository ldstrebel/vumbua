# Scene 1: The Bonfire (Block 99)

**Description:** A makeshift gathering in the industrial sector. The 'Bonfire' is a burning pile of construction scraps in a pit. Far above, the lights of the Spire shimmer where the 'Fancy Parties' are held, but down here, the air smells of smoke and engine grease.
