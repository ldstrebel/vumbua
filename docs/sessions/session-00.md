## Quick Summary

The largest intake class in Vumbua Academy history begins with 100,000 candidates taking the entrance trials. Five unlikely students—two Mizizi cousins, an Ash-Blood pilgrim, a Harmony boiler worker, and a mysterious Earthkin—meet during the chaos of intake and are drawn together by fate, curiosity, and a bonfire invitation.

## Scenes

### Scene 1: The Turtle-Mushroom Fate

**Location:** Virtual Tabletop (Meta)  
**Time:** Session Start

**GM (LUKE S)** (Laughing) Yeah, you were a turtle combined with the mushroom. Turtle mushroom thing.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** Literally mine too. I'm telling you there's like—we think the same or something.

**JOHN HAGEY (IGNATIUS)** This was fate. This was decided by fate. We're not changing anything.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** You can't fight fate.

**GM (LUKE S)** And you just defined your clan so well... the turtle mushroom folk who live in the swamp.

**(NARRATION)**

**GM (LUKE S)** Your home is inside this huge fossilized mega-flora... somewhere between the Pandora tree and hobbit holes. Your family history is all about one thing: "When things must die." The legends, the lore that you have been taught as a harrowing tale is: **"When things stop dying, we start dying."**

(Beat)

**GM (LUKE S)** It's weird... like a relationship with life and death that's not normal. It's scary when things stop dying. And that's why your clan has been really concerned lately because things *have* started to not die. The forest, which kept you segregated for hundreds of years, failed. The lore often talks about how the purpose of the forest is to keep you apart from the world because when the world comes, things stop dying.

**Player Discoveries:**
- Mizizi are turtle-mushroom hybrid people
- Core philosophy: "When things stop dying, we start dying"
- They live in hollowed fossilized mega-trees
- The forest recently "failed" - things won't die properly anymore
- This fulfills a prophecy: "When the world comes, things stop dying"

**GM Notes:**
> [!NOTE]
> Players don't yet know the forest is a data archive. They genuinely believe it's supposed to decay.

### Scene 2: The Arrival of The Paper Man (Flashback)

**Location:** Mizizi Forest  
**Time:** 1-2 cycles ago (flashback)

**GM (LUKE S)** Last cycle, or maybe two cycles ago... a group came, led by a man in what seemed to you to be a very sterile outfit. It didn't have any moss growing off of it. It had no holes in it. It was just very bland and had metal on it. Y'all don't wear metal.

**GM (LUKE S)** The man started bringing things that the elders were now distributing to the clan... you became like the fire brigade. You were starting to just try to destroy the forest around you to get it to die. Harmony comes and they seem to take the soil and the roots and the bark and the stone... neither really are you sure what they're looking for. But in return, they're giving you weapons to destroy your home, which is exactly what you want.

**(RETURN TO TABLE)**

**GM (LUKE S)** Now the next generation has come... the Paper Man has offered much more of the Mycelium clan can now join the Vumbua Academy this year, and the two of you elected to join.

**Player Discoveries:**
- Harmony made contact 1-2 cycles ago
- "The Paper Man" led the expedition (sterile metal outfit)
- Harmony provides tools to destroy the forest (solvents, weapons)
- In return, Harmony takes soil, roots, bark, and stone
- Neither side fully understands what the other wants
- Many Mizizi were invited to the Academy this year

**GM Notes:**
> [!NOTE]
> The "destroy the forest" bargain is mutual ignorance. Harmony doesn't know it's a library; Mizizi think they're preventing apocalypse.

### Scene 3: The Cousins

**Location:** Virtual Tabletop  
**NPCs:** Britt and Aggie establishing relationship

**GM (LUKE S)** (To Sophie) Sophie, your character is maybe a little bit outspoken... uncertain about their relationship with Harmony, maybe even a little suspicious of it. And Kristina (Aggie), maybe you have had some gossip together about Harmony... but she may not be quite as aggressive as you.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** How would we know each other? I feel like our clan's probably not that big, right?

**GM (LUKE S)** Correct. Everyone probably knows everybody.

**AGGIE (VIA LUKE S)** (Relayed thought) I feel like it would be distant relatives... maybe cousins or second cousins. Know enough about each other that when we find out we're going to the same school, it makes sense they would connect.

**LUKE FOREMAN (LOMI)** Same year at Turtle Camp.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** (Excited) What if we're cousins and we're in the same year at school? We've always been sort of forced together... but we obviously are similar in a lot of ways.

**GM (LUKE S)** Like we go to school but we're very different groups... outspoken versus the quiet.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** I'm gonna add to our story here. I'm going to say I've had the same thoughts. We're both sort of in cahoots on like—**something is wrong**. The call is coming from inside the house. And we're about to go save our families and save all of our people... we have a mission and we're going to do it together.

**Player Discoveries:**
- Britt is outspoken and suspicious of Harmony
- Aggie is quieter but similarly concerned
- They're cousins (or second cousins)
- Same year at "school" (cultural education)
- They both sense something is wrong
- Shared mission: Save their people

**GM Notes:**
> [!NOTE]
> Britt's suspicion is well-founded. The forest destruction is a tragedy in progress.

### Scene 4: Civilization

**Location:** Edge of the Petrified Forest  
**Time:** Journey to Vumbua  
**NPCs:** Britt, Aggie

**BRITT** (Gray, dusty, powdery fungal-turtle) and **AGGIE** (Red-and-white spotted mushroom-turtle) step out of the petrified woods.

**GM (LUKE S)** You pop out in the edge of the forest... you can see what you can only really define as "civilization" coming. It is a sprawling tower surrounded by huge buildings and all of these moving metal creatures... It is an assault on your senses.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** (Narrating Action) I think my gut reaction would be to grab Kristina. Like my body stiffens and I feel overwhelmed and stunned and I communicate that with you just by reaching out.

**AGGIE (VIA LUKE S)** (Narrating Action) I think my character would be looking for a darker corner or wall... looking for that safe spot. So she kind of grabs back and waddles off to find that safe spot.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** (To Aggie) Are you more turtle or more fungus?

**AGGIE (VIA LUKE S)** Shape-wise turtle... but definitely on the mushroom side. I want the turtle shell to be like the red and white spotted mushroom that you drop into.

**SOPHIE (BRITT)** I'm going to be a similar vibe... but much more gray and sort of dusty, powdery.

**GM (LUKE S)** As you exit this forest, you're close enough to the Ash Bloods' homes that you can see on the horizon the smoke of their perpetual volcano. And the only people out here are the folks who have made arrangements with the Mycelium clan to come and harvest some of the wood... logging is helping kill the forest and then it's just growing right back.

**Player Discoveries:**
- Vumbua is a sprawling city with towers and metal constructs
- Overwhelming sensory experience for forest-dwellers
- Britt is gray/dusty fungal-turtle
- Aggie is red-and-white spotted mushroom-turtle
- Ash-Blood volcanoes visible on the horizon
- Logging operations near Mizizi forest (forest regrows immediately)

### Scene 5: The Docks - Iggy Emerges

**Location:** Vumbua Docks  
**Time:** Day of Arrival  
**NPCs:** The Mole/Iggy, Old Man

**THE MOLE (HOLLY)**, a chronically sickly Earthkin made of packed, crumbling dirt, emerges from the water. He wears large goggles over giant bug eyes.

**THE MOLE (HOLLY)** (Mumbling, frantic) I gotta get more sunscreen.

He scrambles to cover himself, injecting pressurized fluid into his goggles to stop them from steaming in the sun. He moves erratically, taking a zigzagging route to absorb information while covering his tracks.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Describing the Scene) I kind of like this idea that when he came up... there was an old man sitting on the side of the wharf... just waddles over and throws a really heavy trench coat on top of you. And it's very heavy and it compresses on your shoulders a little bit.

**THE MOLE (HOLLY)** (Exhales deeply) (Blinks, shooting water out of goggles) ...Contentment as he has weight back on him.

**Player Discoveries:**
- Iggy is an Earthkin (small, dirt/earth-based)
- He emerged from the water at the docks
- Extremely light-sensitive (needs goggles, sunscreen)
- Pressure-sensitive (feels relief when weight is applied)
- An old man helped him with a heavy trench coat
- Moves erratically, seems disoriented on the surface

**GM Notes:**
> [!NOTE]
> Iggy is actually Trench-Kin from deep ocean/earth. The pressure sensitivity, light sensitivity, and water emergence are all clues. Players don't know this yet.

### Scene 6: The Pilgrimage

**Location:** The Ember Trail to Vumbua  
**Time:** Day of Arrival  
**NPCs:** Ignatius

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)**, a rebellious Emberkin teenager with a backpack, arrives in the city. He looks at the magitek lights powered by Harmony's crystal batteries.

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** (Internal Monologue) We're subbing out our own fuel for this fake stuff. It's all fake. It's all wrong. It's not how it should be.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Clarifying) To the elders, you were banished to this trial of adventure...

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** (To the Elders, in Flashback) No, this is simply a pilgrimage.

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** (Internal Monologue) I'm going to find the new source of heat for the clan and everything's going to go back to the way it should be.

**Player Discoveries:**
- Ignatius is an Ash-Blood teenager
- Views Harmony's "Safe-Flame" (crystal batteries) as fake/wrong
- Elders say he's "banished to trial"
- Ignatius reframes it as a "pilgrimage"
- His goal: Find new heat source for his clan
- Believes things can "go back to the way it should be"

**GM Notes:**
> [!NOTE]
> Ignatius doesn't realize his clan is already thriving due to integration. The "new heat" he seeks is the network itself, not an external source.

### Scene 7: The Boiler Room

**Location:** Vumbua Under-City - Boiler Room  
**Time:** End of Shift  
**NPCs:** Lomi, Receptionist

**LOMI (LUKE F)** finishes a shift at the furnace. He is a "blue-collar grease monkey," perpetually covered in soot and dirt. He grabs his gear, not bothering to shower, and heads up to the Academy.

**EXT. VUMBUA STREETS - CONTINUOUS**

Lomi walks toward the Academy. He spots a **RECEPTIONIST** casually shredding a document and tossing it into a bin without looking. Lomi stops.

**LOMI (LUKE F)** Hey, you know, there's people in this city that take care of that stuff. You know, it doesn't just get done.

The Receptionist stares at him.

**LOMI (LUKE F)** Public infrastructure is important and there are people that run this city.

Lomi walks away, muttering. He recalls his family's advice: *"Someone's got to fix the ship if it goes wrong."*

**Player Discoveries:**
- Lomi is a Harmony-born worker (not from a clan)
- Works in the boiler room (furnace shifts)
- Family tradition: "Someone's got to fix the ship"
- Advocates for workers and infrastructure
- Doesn't clean up before going to Academy (practical, working-class)
- Values the labor that keeps things running

### Scene 8: The Trials

**Location:** Vumbua Academy - Great Hall  
**Time:** Intake Day  
**NPCs:** 100,000 candidates

The group joins 100,000 other candidates.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) The application is... you show up to take the trials and that's your application... that's why there's 100,000 people showing up.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Describing the Vibe) "Come be an explorer. The time is now. The world is open." Very 1920s somewhere in between like *Avatar Korra* type world that's just really excited for this opportunity.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Explaining the Mechanics) The trials is what ranks your likelihood of being a successful candidate... it gives you a role, an explorer role... which it basically is going to be your Daggerheart Class.

The players take the assessment (a meta-game survey).

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** This feels like *Ender's Game* style stuff and I love it.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Reviewing Results) I was determined to make it so that it would be really hard to meta the result. It is... super interesting.

**LOMI (LUKE F)** Is it an "Oops, all bards" situation or are we pretty good?

**GM (LUKE S)** No, no, it's actually like... the party is pretty well balanced. Like zero repeat classes.

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** Wow. Even me and Kristina (Aggie) didn't have the same one?

**GM (LUKE S)** No, you guys do not. Not really even close on this one.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Closing the Session) The crew will have a chance at the "Chosen One" storyline. I'll tell you that like... none of you are "Rust," which is the bottom tier.

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** Yo, good work team.

**Player Discoveries:**
- 100,000 candidates taking the trials
- Application = showing up
- 1920s-style excitement about exploration ("The world is open!")
- Trials determine role/class and rank
- Party is well-balanced (no repeat classes)
- None of the party are "Rust" rank (bottom tier)
- Rust = likely to be culled

**GM Notes:**
> [!NOTE]
> Actual ranks: Britt and Iggy are Gold, Aggie and Ignatius are Silver, Lomi is Copper. This will be revealed in Session 1.
