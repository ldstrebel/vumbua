# Session 2 Planning

## Goals
- **Bonfire Scene**: Socialize, learn lore, get hints for the Gen-Ed test.
- **First Classes**: "Gen-Ed - Exploration 101".
- **World Building**: Show, don't just tell, the diversity and scale of Harmony/Vumbua.

## Gen-Ed Test Hints (To be learned at Bonfire)
The "Gen-Ed" test is a mix of theory and practical simulations. Players can pick up answers if they listen to the right people.

1.  **Cartography: The Z-Axis Paradox**
    - *Scenario*: Solar Gale vs 45-degree rotation.
    - *Hint*: A rich kid is bragging about the "Dead-Stick Drop" (Savant move), but **Cassius** (a nervous, bookish student) corrects him: "The manual says Synchronized Helix if you want to pass."

2.  **Resonance: The Weeping Node**
    - *Scenario*: A Node "weeping" spores. Standard protocol is C-Major Pulse.
    - *Hint*: **Rill** (the only other Mizizi on campus, currently a researcher) is seen arguing with a professor about "Standard Protocol". She whispers to Britt/Aggie: "You can't cure sadness with a hammer. You have to cry with it."

3.  **The Anchor of Self: The Dissolution**
    - *Scenario*: Legs turning to steam/mist.
    - *Hint*: An old veteran drinking heavily: "It's not about magic anchors. It's about remembering who you are. The mist takes the weak-willed. Hold onto your **Flaw**—it's the only thing that's real."

4.  **Crisis Management: The Breach**
    - *Scenario*: Hull breach in Kitchen and Engine. Only one patch.
    - *Hint*: A Grinder (boiler worker): "Food is a luxury. Power is life. A dead engine is just a fancy coffin." (Patch Engine).

5.  **Xenobiology: The Void-Lily**
    - *Scenario*: A weed that eats resources but supports the ecosystem.
    - *Hint*: "Sometimes you gotta lie to the suits to save the forest. Just mask the signal. It was never there."

6.  **First Contact: The Spear**
    - *Scenario*: Terrified local with a spear.
    - *Hint*: "If you act like a soldier, they'll act like a warrior. Be vulnerable. Sit down."

## Scene 1: The Bonfire (Block 99)

**Setting**:
- A makeshift gathering in the "industrial" sector (Block 99).
- The "Bonfire" is a burning pile of construction scraps in a pit, possibly lit by a young Ash-Blood or just chemical accelerants.
- **Seraphina "Serra" Vox**: From the powerful Vox family (Energy Magnates). She's hiding her identity to "make it on her own" (and avoid assassination attempts?). She's eager, scribbling notes, and wants to know *everything* about the new clans.

**Key NPCs**:
- **Seraphina "Serra" Vox**: Eager, scribbling notes. Wants to know *everything* about the new clans.
- **Lucky**: Selling "answers" to the test (50% chance they are wrong, or riddles).
- **"Sarge" (Loami's friend)**: Struggling, maybe drinking too much "engine hooch".
- **Rival Cliques**:
    - *The Legacy Kids*: Descendants of famous explorers, think they own the place.
    - *The Grinders*: Industrial workers (like Loami) looking to break out.

**Encounters**:
1.  **The Speculators**: A group of students arguing about the "Two Missing Clans". Everyone knows the Four (Ash-Blood, Mizizi, Wadi, Renali), but the "Sixfold Theory" claims there must be Earth and Lightning clans too. They are placing bets on where they are hiding (e.g., "Under the crust?" "In the storm clouds?").
2.  **The "Fake" Map**: Someone selling a "map of the test". It's actually a map of the cafeteria menu.
3.  **Ash-Blood & Mizizi Interest**: Students circling Ignatius and the Mizizi cousins, asking insensitive questions ("Do you really eat rocks?", "Can I smoke your moss?").

## Scene 2: The Semester Montage (Weeks 1-4)

**Concept**: A narrative montage covering the first month of classes. Players describe one key moment of their studies.

**Mechanic: Focus & Describe**
1.  **Choose a Focus**: Pick a Skill or Domain (e.g., Piloting, Arcana, Skullduggery).
2.  **Describe a Moment**: Narrate a scene of struggle, breakthrough, or trouble.
3.  **The Roll**: Make an Action Roll (Stat + 2d12).

**Outcomes**:
-   **Success with Hope**: **Top of the Class**. Gain a temporary **Experience** (e.g., *"Aced the Midterm"*) usable once during the Exam.
-   **Success with Fear**: **Passed, but...**: You passed, but attracted unwanted attention or owe a favor.
-   **Failure with Hope**: **Hard Lesson**: You failed the specific task, but learned from it. Clear 1 Stress or gain a **Hope**.
-   **Failure with Fear**: **Academic Probation**: The Professor hates you. Mark a Condition (e.g., *Stressed* or *Insecure*).

## Scene 3: Gen-Ed - Exploration 101 (The Written Assessment)

**Setting**:
- A massive "Exam Hall" with thousands of clacking brass terminals.
- **Dean Isolde Vane** presides from a floating podium.

**The Assessment**:
**The Assessment**:
- Players take the "Final Venture Exam" (the JSON survey) as a literal **10-question written test**.
- **Mechanic**:
    -   recall hints from Bonfire.
    -   **Savant Answer (10 pts)**: Riskier but "Real".
    -   **Textbook Answer (7 pts)**: Safe/Harmony standard.
- The default "harmony" answers are technically correct, but the "Savant" answers show you know the *reality* of the world (e.g. Steam powered by Crystal Batteries = Arcane Tech).

**The Twist**:
- Mid-exam, the screens glitch. A "Live Feed" from a real explorer pops up, showing something terrifying (a void-beast? a total wipeout?) before being cut. The Dean claims it was "Part of the stress test".

## Scene 4: Practical Assessment - "The Simulations" (Afternoon)

**Setting**:
- The "Prove-It Grounds" and "Sim-Pods".
- Instructors: **Sergeant Kael** and **Professor Aris**.

**The Activity (Dice Rolls from Survey)**:
1.  **Aether-Graph Plot (Agility)**: Plotting navigation in a non-Euclidean archipelago.
    -   *Iggy's Secret*: The shapes make sense to him (+2 Bonus).
2.  **The Density Chamber (Constitution/Strength)**: Surviving 400% gravity.
    -   *Iggy's Secret*: He's used to deep pressure (+2 Bonus).
3.  **The Blind Fly (Instinct)**: Landing a ship with no visibility.
    -   *Loami's Secret*: Feel the gears, don't look (+4 Bonus).
4.  **The Tuning Injection (Tech/Dexterity)**: Stabilizing a vibrating crystal.
    -   *Loami's Secret*: Inject the internal core, not the surface.

**Mechanics**:
- Roll the corresponding stats.
- **Success**: "Butter-smooth landing" / "Perfect Plot".
- **Partial**: "Controlled Crash".
- **Fail**: "Fire and Ash".

## World Building Details

**Food & Drink**:
- *Bonfire Snacks*: "Magma-Pop" (spicy popcorn cooked on Ash-Blood skin), "Fungal-Chips" (Mizizi snacks, widely popular), "Engine-Hooch" (strong, oily alcohol).
- *Academy Food*: "Nutri-Paste" (efficient, bland) vs "Captain's Table" (real food for high ranks).

**Music & Culture**:
- *Music*: Rhythmic, industrial beats ("Clank-Step") mixed with ethereal wind-chime sounds (Harmony traditional).
- *Fashion*: High-contrast. Wealthy students wear "Clean-Suits" (pristine white/gold). Workers/Clans wear "Tech-Wear" (utility belts, goggles, patches).

**Slang**:
- "Glitch" (someone acting weird/crazy).
- "Sparkless" (boring/uninspired).
- "Void-Touched" (creepy/lucky).

## Decisions & Clarifications

1.  **Factions/Harmony**:
    - *Definition*: Harmony is the "Ruling Coalition" or "The Sixth Clan" (Direction). Includes the Great Families (Vox, Vane, Sterling).
    - *Action*: Create `docs/lore/factions/harmony.md` to define these families.

2.  **Timekeeping**:
    - *Decision*: Hard clock times for Academy (regimented, industrial).

3.  **Names**:
    - *Decision*: "Ignatius of Magma" is a pretentious title. Rill is the only other Mizizi.

4.  **Tech Level**:
    - *Clarification*: **Crystal-Punk**. Common tech is Steam/Mechanical, but the *energy source* is Harmony Crystal Batteries (Arcane-like).
    - *Visual*: Glowing blue crystals slotted into brass boilers.

5.  **Gen-Ed Test**:
    - *Format*: 10-question written test (Morning) followed by Practical Sims (Afternoon).
