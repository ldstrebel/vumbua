## Current Arc: The Intake

### [[Session 00|Session 0: The Trials]]

- Vumbua is a modular city built around three Cores
- The Academy expects massive attrition
- Testing assigns roles, not just ranks

### [[Session 01|Session 1: First Day]]
**Date:** [Next session]

Housing assignments scatter the group, but curiosity brings them back together. A mysterious student named **Seraphina "Serra" Vox** (posing as "Serra Vox") extends an olive branch, and secrets begin to surface.

**Key Events:**
- Dorm assignments (Block 12, Block 99, Block 04)
- Iggy climbs a crane to "touch the sky"
- **Seraphina "Serra" Vox** introduces herself as an "ally" (hiding her noble status)
- The group learns about Rill, a Wadi researcher at the Academy
- Lucky the hustler makes his first deals

**Players Discovered:**
- Rill left the Mizizi forest 2 years ago seeking answers
- The campus is temporary, using repurposed buildings
- A major cull is coming after the first voyage

### [[Session 02|Session 2: The Bonfire]]
**Date:** [Next session]

The party's first night at Vumbua. A bonfire at Block 99 becomes the stage for new friendships, philosophical debates, and one spectacular lightning bolt.

**Key Events:**
- [[Cassius Thorne]] obsessively arranges logs; charmed by Lomi
- [[Serra Vox]] slips about political connections to The Seat
- The Speculators' Debate: [[Percival Vane-Smythe III|Percy]]'s Sixfold Theory vs [[Iron-Jaw Jax|Jax]]'s skepticism vs [[Bramble]]'s philosophy
- Serra explains the **Inverse Power Doctrine** ([[Lady Ignis]] holds highest voting power)
- [[Mizizi]]/Harmony cultural exchange about death
- **[[Zephyr]]'s Lightning:** Purple bolt from clear sky; she's unharmed
- [[Rill]] retrieves Zephyr, invites Britt/Aggie to find her after class
- Ash-Blood cultural divide revealed: traditionalists vs modernizers
- Leidian properties discussed (80% hotter, halflife, distance decay)
- Party heads to the Celestial Lounge

**Players Discovered:**
- The Inverse Power Doctrine (newest member gets highest voting power)
- Lady Ignis is essentially "President" of Harmony
- The Sixfold Theory (missing Earth, Air, Water clans)
- Zephyr can cause purple lightning
- Leidian is burning 80% hotter since integration
- Ash-Blood cultural divide between fire-keepers and battery-adopters
- The Mizizi forest has no clear "purpose" unlike other nodes
- Academy structure: classes → exam → Loom → rest week → trial venture

### [[Session 02Pt5|Session 2.5: The Power Room]]
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Type:** 1-on-1 side session (Iggy / Holly)

While the party socializes at the bonfire, Iggy slips away to explore the Academy's power plant. He discovers the resonator battery infrastructure and meets **[[Professor Kante]]**, a tortoise professor of harmonics who draws him into a conversation about the [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] decline and the Ash-Blood Anomaly.

**Key Events:**
- Iggy Irish-goodbyes from the bonfire to investigate the power plant
- Meets [[Tommy]] (gnome clerk) and [[Lucina]] (dwarf mechanic) in the lobby
- Discovers over-engineered Panda 5 resonator batteries and charts showing the Global Amplitude decline
- Professor Kante appears and explains the Minimum Crisis and the missing Ash-Blood surge
- Kante gives Iggy an umber crystal and invites him to return as a collaborator
- Iggy rejoins the group for the Celestial Lounge trip

**Players Discovered:**
- The Global Amplitude measures Harmony's total ether power — it increases with each node integration
- The amplitude has been declining for 30-40 years — unprecedented in recorded history
- The Ash-Blood integration produced only ~20 amps instead of expected +300 to +800
- Panda 5 batteries are surge regulators/receptors, not storage — powered by umber crystals
- The Night of Sparks (~400 years ago) burned the world for two months due to unregulated surge
- The Apex 1 next-gen battery line was scrapped because the expected surge never came
- Professor Kante's theory: integration works through cultural connection, not resource extraction
- The [[Trench-Kin]] are known to Harmony as border defenders ("trail tales from the Trench")
