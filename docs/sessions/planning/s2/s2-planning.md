# Session 2 Planning

## Goals
- **Bonfire Scene**: Socialize, learn lore, get hints for the Gen-Ed test.
- **First Classes**: "Gen-Ed - Exploration 101".
- **World Building**: Show, don't just tell, the diversity and scale of Harmony/Vumbua.

## Gen-Ed Test Hints (To be learned at Bonfire)
The "Gen-Ed" test is a mix of theory and practical simulations. Players can pick up answers if they listen to the right people.

1.  **Cartography: The Z-Axis Paradox**
    - *Scenario*: Solar Gale vs 45-degree rotation.
    - *Hint*: A rich kid is bragging about the "Dead-Stick Drop" (Savant move), but **Cassius** (a nervous, bookish student) corrects him: "The manual says Synchronized Helix if you want to pass."

2.  **Resonance: The Weeping Node**
    - *Scenario*: A Node "weeping" spores. Standard protocol is C-Major Pulse.
    - *Hint*: **[[Rill]]** (the only other [[Mizizi]] on campus, currently a researcher) is seen arguing with a professor about "Standard Protocol". She whispers to [[Britt]]/[[Aggie]]: "You can't cure sadness with a hammer. You have to cry with it."

3.  **The Anchor of Self: The Dissolution**
    - *Scenario*: Legs turning to steam/mist.
    - *Hint*: An old veteran drinking heavily: "It's not about magic anchors. It's about remembering who you are. The mist takes the weak-willed. Hold onto your **Flaw**—it's the only thing that's real."

4.  **Crisis Management: The Breach**
    - *Scenario*: Hull breach in Kitchen and Engine. Only one patch.
    - *Hint*: A Grinder (boiler worker): "Food is a luxury. Power is life. A dead engine is just a fancy coffin." (Patch Engine).

5.  **Xenobiology: The Void-Lily**
    - *Scenario*: A weed that eats resources but supports the ecosystem.
    - *Hint*: "Sometimes you gotta lie to the suits to save the forest. Just mask the signal. It was never there."

6.  **First Contact: The Spear**
    - *Scenario*: Terrified local with a spear.
    - *Hint*: "If you act like a soldier, they'll act like a warrior. Be vulnerable. Sit down."

## Establishing Shot: The Academy at Night

**Location:** [[Vumbua Academy]] - The sprawling mobile city-state, currently at rest

## Scene 1: The Bonfire at Block 99

### Opening

**[Out of Character - Setting the Stage]**

[[Vumbua Academy]] doesn't do anything small. 

Tonight, scattered across the temporary industrial sprawl of Block 99, there are maybe 150-200 first-years gathered around makeshift fires. Construction scraps burn in metal drums. Contraband engine-hooch makes the rounds. Among the 70,000 students crammed into this repurposed expedition city, these bonfires are where the real introductions happen.

Your party—[[Ignatius]], [[Britt]], [[Aggie]], Loami, and [[Iggy]]—are vanishingly rare. Clan members at Vumbua number in the hundreds at most. You WILL be noticed.

---

**[What the Players See]**

You approach one of the larger fire pits—someone clearly put effort into this one. Actual seating. Symmetrical log arrangement. A nervous-looking student (Cassius) is fussing with the wood placement while a well-dressed young woman (Serra) sits nearby, notebook open, asking questions to anyone who'll listen.

Cassius spots Loami and waves frantically. "Hey! You—boiler-wear, right? Can you help with this? I'm trying to get the thermal distribution right but—"

Serra's eyes light up when she sees the rest of you. She stands, smoothing her dress. "Oh! You must be from the clans. Please, sit! I'd love to hear about—" She catches herself, tries to sound casual. "I mean, if you want to chat. No pressure."

Around you, the bonfire sprawls in all directions. Groups cluster around different fires:
- **Percy's debate circle** - someone's arguing about missing clans with a chalkboard
- **Lucky's corner** - sealed envelopes changing hands for coin
- **The Legacy Table** - raised platform with expensive-looking students
- **The Grinder's pit** - rough laughter and the smell of fried fungus

**The night is yours. What do you do?**

## The Bonfire Hooks

**General Atmosphere:** 
The bonfire in Block 99 is one of dozens happening tonight across the Academy. This particular gathering has about 150-200 students—a mix of first-years, upper-classmen, and hangers-on. The fire crackles in an industrial pit, fed by construction scraps and possibly a young Ash-Blood showing off.

---

## NPC Knowledge Boundaries

**What is PUBLIC knowledge (most students know):**
- **Harmony** is the ruling coalition that governs from [[Vumbua Academy]]
- The Academy trains **Exploranauts** (explorers/scouts) to map and integrate new territories
- **Two clans** have been discovered and are being integrated:
  - **Ash-Bloods** (volcanic fire people) - discovered 24 months ago, ~200 at Academy
  - **Mizizi** (fungal-turtle people) - discovered 4 months ago, only 3 at Academy (Britt, Aggie, Rill)
- Clan members are **extremely rare** at the Academy (few hundred total among 70k students)
- The world is dangerous - "out there" is full of void-beasts, unstable reality, and death
- Harmony brings "stability" and "order" to chaotic territories
- Crystal batteries power everything (but how they work is mysterious)
- Integration means cooperation, trade, mutual benefit

**What is FRINGE knowledge (conspiracy theorists, academics, some nobles):**
- The **"Sixfold Theory"** - a fringe academic theory that there should be six clans based on symbolic patterns
- Speculation about "missing" Earth and Lightning clans (most people think this is nonsense)
- Some wonder if there are other undiscovered clans beyond [[Ash-Bloods]] and [[Mizizi]]
- Theories that the two known clans might be connected somehow (very fringe)

**What is SECRET ([[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Isolde]], researchers like [[Rill]], maybe a few professors):**
- The clans are parts of an ancient system/circuit
- The integration percentages and why they matter
- The Imperial Archive / Mizizi forest being a data storage system
- The actual mechanics of "The Great Stitching"
- **That other clans exist** ([[Wadi]], [[Trench-Kin]], [[Renali]] are completely unknown to Harmony)

**NPC Knowledge by Background:**
- **Harmony Nobles** ([[Percival Vane-Smythe III|Percy]], Val, Glimmer): Know official doctrine about Ash-Bloods and Mizizi, family business interests, political maneuvering
- **Legacy Kids** (Cassius, Silas): Read the manuals about the two known clans, know explorer protocols, heard family stories
- **Workers/Grinders** ([[Ratchet]], [[Brawn]], [[Sarge]]): Practical knowledge about working with Ash-Bloods in boiler rooms, how things actually work
- **Researchers** (Rill): Secretly knows about other clans from Exchange system, but can't reveal this without exposing herself
- **Students** (Serra, [[Mira]], [[Lucky]]): Mix of textbook learning about the two clans and rumors, trying to piece things together

**CRITICAL:** When NPCs say "the clans," they mean Ash-Bloods and Mizizi. Period. They don't know Wadi, Renali, or Trench-Kin exist.

---



### Hook #1: The Speculators' Debate
**Location:** Near the fire, heated argument in progress  
**NPCs (4):**

- **Percival "Percy" Vane-Smythe III** (Human, Clean-Suit, pampered Harmony noble)
- **[[Iron-Jaw Jax]]** (Construct/Warforged, veteran, scarred)
- **[[Bramble]]** (Plant-person, possibly Mizizi-adjacent, vine-covered)
- **[[Zephyr]]** (Mysterious student, crackling with static, rumored to be "void-touched") - students recognize her from the intake incident

**The Scene:**
Percy is holding court about a fringe theory he read in some obscure academic journal. Most people think he's ridiculous, but he's got a chalkboard and he's very enthusiastic.

- **Percy**: "I'll wager 50 sovereigns there's an Earth Clan underground! The 'Sixfold Theory' says there must be six total, not just two!"
- **[[Iron-Jaw Jax|Jax]]**: (Dismissive) "Kid, that's academic nonsense. We found the Ash-Bloods and the Mizizi. That's probably all there is."
- **Percy**: "But the symmetry! Fire, Plant... there must be Water, Metal, Earth, Lightning! It *must* be complete!"
- **Bramble**: (Quiet, thoughtful) "What if... they're not missing? What if we're the ones who forgot?"
- **Zephyr**: (Nervous, crackling louder) "Or maybe the world really IS just broken. Not everything needs to be a pattern."
- **Percy**: "Mark my words! When they find the missing clans, I'll be vindicated!"

**NPC Perspectives on Vumbua/Harmony:**

- **Percy (The Counter-Trope Noble)**: 
  - **Not** your typical arrogant rich kid—he's genuinely curious and reads obscure journals
  - Views Vumbua as "the greatest library in the world" and wants to be an academic, not a captain
  - Family expects him to join the military (House Vane tradition), but he'd rather study
  - Believes Harmony's mission is noble: "We're preserving knowledge and preventing another Dark Age"
  - Frustrated that most nobles see exploration as conquest, not discovery
  - **Day-to-day**: Sneaks into restricted archives, annoys professors with questions, writes terrible poetry about the Aether
  
- **Jax (The Counter-Trope Construct)**:
  - **Not** emotionless—deeply cynical and drinks to forget
  - Former Exploranaut who's "seen some shit" in the deep places
  - Views Vumbua as "a meat grinder with pretty banners"
  - Believes Harmony lies about how dangerous it really is: "They send kids out there to die and call it 'education'"
  - Stayed at Academy as maintenance crew because he can't face going back out
  - **Counter-Harmony view**: "They found the Ash-Bloods because the Ash-Bloods LET them. Same with the Mizizi. We're not conquering—we're being allowed in."
  - **Day-to-day**: Works night shifts fixing the cranes, avoids talking about his past, warns kids away from the "glory"

- **Bramble (The Mysterious Botanist)**:
  - Nobody knows what Bramble is—plant-person? Harmony botanist who got weird? Mizizi experiment?
  - **Counter-trope**: Speaks in complete sentences, not riddles or mysticism—just thoughtful and slow
  - Views Vumbua as "a gardener who doesn't understand the garden"
  - Believes Harmony makes the same mistake repeatedly: "They take without giving. Roots need flow."
  - Works in the greenhouse, studies Mizizi bark samples, writes meticulous notes
  - **Day-to-day**: Tends to plants that "shouldn't grow here," leaves cryptic diagrams in the library, rarely sleeps

- **Zephyr (The Chaotic Wind)**:
  - **Not** mysterious by choice—she just doesn't understand why everyone is so SERIOUS
  - Views Vumbua as "a big metal cage that doesn't fly right"
  - Frustrated by Harmony's obsession with structure: "Why do you need so many RULES for everything?"
  - Thinks the Dean is nice but talks too much
  - **Day-to-day**: Breaks minor rules constantly (shows up late, sleeps on rooftops, forgets her room assignment)

**Test Answer Integration:**
- **Hint**: Percy mentions the Sixfold Theory will be on the test (Gen-Ed Question: academic trivia)
- **How to slip it in**: If PCs engage Percy, he'll excitedly explain: "The test always has one question about fringe theories. You just need to know what they ARE, not whether they're true. Six clans: Fire, Water, Plant, Metal, Earth, Lightning. Easy marks!"

**Player Engagement:**
- Most students roll their eyes at Percy—this is fringe theory stuff
- Some students recognize Zephyr from the intake incident and whisper about her
- The players might be asked to weigh in (do the clans have theories about other clans?)
- Percy might try to recruit them for an expedition to find the "missing" clans
- Bramble will be particularly interested in [[Britt]]/[[Aggie]] as "forest kin"—might ask about "the flow" in the Petrified Forest
- Jax might pull [[Ignatius]] aside and warn: "Kid, they'll work you till you burn out. Literally."
- Zephyr seems unusually nervous about this topic - why? And why did she sneak out to come here?

---

### Hook #2: Lucky's Scam Operation
**Location:** Corner of the gathering, shady deals happening  
**NPCs (3):**

- **Lucky** (Human, street-smart hustler, carrying a satchel)
- **Sarge** (Gruff veteran, Loami's friend, drunk on engine-hooch)
- **[[Pudge]]** (Rotund cook, soft-hearted enabler)

**The Scene:**
Lucky is selling "answers" to tomorrow's Gen-Ed test. They're wrapped in sealed envelopes. Sarge is slumped nearby, muttering warnings that nobody listens to. Pudge is trying (and failing) to stop people from buying.

- **Lucky**: (Slick smile) "First-years! I got what you need! 20 sovereigns for the whole answer key!"
- **Sarge**: (Slurring) "It's a scam... told him last year... nobody listens..."
- **Pudge**: "Lucky, c'mon, these kids need to learn honestly—"
- **Lucky**: "Pudge, I *am* teaching them! Lesson one: trust nobody!"

**NPC Perspectives on Vumbua/Harmony:**

- **Lucky (The Counter-Trope Hustler)**:
  - **Not** actually greedy—gives half his profits to Block 99 families who can't afford tuition
  - Views Vumbua as "a two-tier system pretending to be fair"
  - Believes Harmony's "meritocracy" is a lie: "Rich kids get tutors, we get textbooks from 30 years ago"
  - Runs scams as protest, not profit: "If the game's rigged, might as well have fun with it"
  - **Counter-Harmony view**: "They say 'everyone can succeed' but only if you already know the rules. I'm selling the rules."
  - **Day-to-day**: Fixes gambling pools, smuggles contraband food from the kitchens, runs a "lost and found" that's actually a pawn shop

- **Sarge (The Broken Mentor)**:
  - **Not** a tough-love drill sergeant—he's genuinely traumatized and trying to warn kids
  - Former boiler room supervisor, knew Loami's parents, feels responsible for their deaths
  - Views Vumbua as "a machine that eats workers and shi

ts glory"
  - Believes Harmony builds on the backs of people like Loami: "Your parents die in the engine room, and they give you a scholarship. Call it fair."
  - Drinks to cope with survivor's guilt, stays at Academy to watch over "his strays"
  - **Day-to-day**: Works maintenance, slips food to struggling students, warns first-years about the dangerous assignments

- **Pudge (The Compassionate Enabler)**:
  - **Counter-trope**: Large body, larger heart—not the "jolly fat cook," actually quite serious
  - Head of Block 99 kitchens, former Ash-Blood expedition cook
  - Views Vumbua as "hungry children pretending to be soldiers"
  - Believes in Harmony's IDEALS but not its execution: "Feed people first, THEN ask them to be heroes"
  - Lets Lucky run scams because "at least he's redistributing wealth"
  - **Day-to-day**: Runs an unofficial food bank, teaches cooking classes, keeps emergency rations for students who miss meals

**Test Answer Integration:**
- **The Scam**: Lucky's "answers" are ACTUALLY useful, but cryptic:
  - One envelope says: "Question 4: Look where the fire meets ice. Count the towers."
  - This is a riddle pointing to a real test question about Vumbua's defensive perimeter
- **Real Hint from Sarge**: If PCs talk to Sarge (especially Loami), he'll mutter useful advice:
  - "The test ain't about knowin' the book... it's about knowin' the *world*..."
  - "They'll ask you 'How many defense towers?' The answer's always the same: count 'em yourself. They want Exploranauts, not parrots."
  - This hints that the test will have observational questions, not just memorization

**Player Engagement:**
- Do the players buy the "answers"? (They're riddles that actually help if you think about them)
- Sarge might recognize Loami's tech-wear and stumble over to commiserate: "Your folks... they were good people. Don't let this place grind you down like it did them."
- Pudge might offer free food: "You look hungry. Come by Kitchen 7 anytime. No strings."
- Lucky might try to recruit PCs for bigger scams: "You clan kids are exotic. People trust exotic. Wanna make some coin?"

### Hook #3: Serra's Fire Pit
**Location:** A well-tended fire pit with actual seating  
**NPCs (3):**

- **Seraphina "Serra" Vox** (Hiding her noble identity, eager anthropologist)
- **[[Cassius Thorne]]** (Nervous bookish student, clearly smitten)
- **[[Silas Thorne]]** (Cassius's rebellious cousin, amused spectator)

**The Scene:**
Serra has set up a cozy spot and is interviewing students about clan culture. Cassius is trying desperately to impress her by building an elaborate fire and demonstrating his knowledge, while Silas watches with barely concealed amusement.

- **Serra**: (Writing in notebook) "—and so the Ash-Bloods regulate temperature through...?"
- **Cassius**: (Adjusting the fire anxiously) "I-I read that they can metabolize heat directly! Like this fire—I built it using the three-log method from the Exploranaut's Handbook!"
- **Serra**: (Not looking up) "Fascinating. And the Mizizi spore communication network—"
- **Cassius**: (Desperately) "I could rebuild it as a Synchronized Helix pattern! That's the proper formation for thermal control—"
- **Silas**: (Barely containing laughter) "Cass, she asked about mushrooms, not your campfire flex."
- **Serra**: (Finally noticing Cassius) "Oh! The fire is lovely, Cassius. Very... geometrically sound."
- **Cassius**: (Beaming) "Really? I mean, the manual says for a Solar Gale scenario you should use a Synchronized Helix, not a Dead-Stick Drop—"

**NPC Perspectives on Vumbua/Harmony:**

- **Serra (The Counter-Trope Noble)**:
  - **Not** a shallow socialite—genuinely fascinated by other cultures, hides identity to avoid biasing people
  - Views Vumbua as "the most important anthropological opportunity in generations"
  - Believes Harmony's integration is "clumsy but well-meaning—like a child trying to hug a butterfly"
  - CRITICAL: Doesn't realize how patronizing she can be: "It's amazing how you've adapted to OUR environment!"
  - **Counter-Harmony view**: Wants integration to work but sees the power imbalance: "We should be learning FROM them, not just absorbing them."
  - **Day-to-day**: Takes excessive notes, asks invasive questions, genuinely thinks she's being respectful, donates to clan scholarship funds anonymously

- **Cassius (The Anxious Overachiever)**:
  - **Counter-trope**: Not confident or suave—utterly terrified of failure, memorizes everything to feel safe
  - Views Vumbua as "the only place where knowing the rules matters more than who your parents are"
  - Believes if he just follows the manual PERFECTLY, he'll succeed (doesn't work that way)
  - Family legacy: His mother (Captain Elara Thorne) discovered the Ash-Bloods—HUGE shoes to fill
  - **Day-to-day**: Studies until 3 AM, color-codes his notes, practices tying knots in his sleep, terrified of disappointing his famous mother

- **Silas (The Rebel Cousin)**:
  - **Not** a jerk rebel—actually just wants to DO stuff instead of read about it
  - Views Vumbua as "a library pretending to be an adventure academy"
  - Frustrated that Cassius memorizes while Silas EXPLORES: "The book says 'Synchronized Helix,' but I've built fires in a hurricane. Dead-Stick Drop works better."
  - Believes Harmony focuses too much on theory: "Just GO OUT THERE and figure it out!"
  - **Day-to-day**: Sneaks out to explore restricted zones, gets in trouble for "unsanctioned expeditions," actually good at survival

**Test Answer Integration:**
- **Hint from Cassius**: He'll nervously recite from the manual if PCs engage him:
  - "Question 1 is always about emergency protocols. The answer is Synchronized Helix for fire-building in adverse weather—page 47, paragraph 3!"
  - If PCs seem interested, he'll offer to study with them: "I have ALL the manuals memorized!"
- **Counter-Hint from Silas**: If PCs seem practical, Silas will mutter:
  - "Don't listen to him. Half that manual is outdated. They want to see if you can THINK, not parrot."

**Player Engagement:**
- Serra will eagerly question Ignatius/Britt/Aggie about clan culture (possibly tone-deaf questions like "Do you miss being primitive?")
- Cassius's puppy-dog crush could be endearing or awkward—he'll try to impress clan PCs too: "I read EVERYTHING about your people!"
- Silas might bond with PCs over practical skills: "You actually LIVED in a volcano? That's way cooler than reading about it." 
- Potential tension: Serra taking notes on EVERYTHING the PCs say (feels like being studied)

---

### Hook #4: The Legacy Table
**Location:** Elevated platform, exclusive seating  
**NPCs (4):**

- **Valerius "Val" Sterling** (Dashing noble, Guild House Sterling heir)
- **[[Lady Glimmer]]** (Elegant socialite, dripping with jewelry)
- **[[Kindle]]** (Ash-Blood student, trying desperately to fit in)
- **Mira** (Young student, starry-eyed, taking notes on everything)

**The Scene:**
The "Legacy Kids"—descendants of famous explorers and wealthy families—have claimed a raised section with actual furniture. They're showing off their knowledge and connections.

- **Val**: (Gesturing grandly) "The Dead-Stick Drop is what separates the legends from the textbook followers."
- **Glimmer**: (Examining her nails) "My mother says the Academy is *crawling* with unintegrated elements these days."
- **Kindle**: (Eager, trying too hard) "I could demonstrate! I'm Ash-Blood, I've got natural heat resistance—"
- **Glimmer**: (Cold smile) "How... quaint."
- **Mira**: (Scribbling frantically) "Wait, what's the difference between Dead-Stick and Synchronized Helix?"
- **Val**: "One is for people who want to *pass*. The other is for people who want to *excel*."

**NPC Perspectives on Vumbua/Harmony:**

- **Val (The Counter-Trope Legacy)**: Not a shallow rich kid—actually skilled, aware of his advantages. Views Vumbua as "the family business." Father co-discovered Ash-Bloods—Val respects them genuinely. Day-to-day: Trains obsessively, treats clan students as equals (but still condescending).

- **Glimmer (The Uncomfortable Classist)**: Not evil, just scared of change. Views Vumbua as "declining in standards." Believes integration is "diluting our culture." Day-to-day: Writes complaint letters, avoids clan students.

- **Kindle (The Desperate Assimilator)**: Ash-Blood who desperately wants to be "normal Harmony." Views Vumbua as escape from being "exotic." Tragedy: Tries to fit in with people who'll never fully accept her. Day-to-day: Hides clan accent, studies Harmony etiquette obsessively.

- **Mira (The Earnest Newcomer)**: Working-class scholarship student, chooses optimism. Views Vumbua as "proof different people CAN work together." Day-to-day: Studies with anyone, asks questions out of curiosity.

**Test Answer Integration:**
- **Val's hint**: "Dead-Stick Drop is on the test. Manual says Synchronized Helix, but field reports say Dead-Stick. The test wants to know which you'd ACTUALLY use."
- Creates tension: is the test asking for book answer or practical answer?

**Player Engagement:**
- Kindle might approach Ignatius desperately: "Please don't make a scene. I'm trying to blend in."
- Glimmer's microaggressions could spark conflict
- Val might recruit skilled PCs: "Best teams mix old blood with new fire."
- Mira will ask innocent but probing questions

---

### Hook #5: The Grinder's Truth
**Location:** Grease-stained area near the fire pit, industrial workers gathering  
**NPCs (4):**

- **Ratchet** (Goblin-ish mechanic, covered in oil)
- **Brawn** (Large gentle construct, maintenance worker)
- **[[Celia Vance]]** (Academy administrator, checking in on students)
- **[[Theorem]]** (Academic student, slumming it, out of place)

**The Scene:**
A group of Grinders—the maintenance crew and industrial workers—are eating "Fungal-Chips" and drinking engine-hooch. They're loud, laughing, and sharing war stories. Theorem (an upper-class academic type) is awkwardly trying to fit in. Celia Vance is doing her rounds, making sure nobody's getting *too* drunk.

- **Ratchet**: (Gesturing with a grease-stained bottle) "—so the hull breach is spewing pressure, right? Kitchen's flooded, engine's dying—"
- **Brawn**: (Deep voice, slow) "Only one patch kit."
- **Ratchet**: "EXACTLY! And this rich kid, he's screaming 'SAVE THE KITCHEN!' Like we can eat when we're DEAD!"
- **Theorem**: (Nervous laugh) "Well, morale is important for survival—"
- **Ratchet**: "No, kid. *Power* is survival. A dead engine is a fancy coffin. You patch the ENGINE."
- **Celia**: (Sighing, writing on clipboard) "Please don't teach the first-years to sacrifice food supplies..."
- **Ratchet**: "I'm teachin' 'em to LIVE, Celia!"

**NPC Perspectives on Vumbua/Harmony:**

- **Ratchet (The Pragmatic Survivor)**: Small, scrappy mechanic who's seen it all. Views Vumbua as "fancy nobles playing explorer while WE keep the lights on." Believes Harmony's priorities are backwards: "They train captains but not engineers. Then wonder why ships fail." Day-to-day: Fixes what breaks, drinks to cope, teaches anyone who'll listen about REAL survival.

- **Brawn (The Gentle Giant)**: Large construct, few words, deep wisdom. Views Vumbua as "loud and wasteful." Believes actions matter more than words: doesn't argue, just DOES. Counter-trope: Not stupid or violent—thoughtful and kind. Day-to-day: Lifts heavy things, protects smaller workers, remembers everyone's names.

- **Celia Vance (The Burned-Out Administrator)**: Mid-level admin trying to keep students safe. Views Vumbua as "a bureaucratic nightmare where paperwork matters more than people." Caught between rules and compassion. Day-to-day: Does her rounds, files incident reports, secretly warns students about dangerous assignments.

- **Theorem (The Fish Out of Water)**: Upper-class student trying to understand "how the other half lives." Views Vumbua as "two academies in one—theory for nobles, practice for workers." Genuinely wants to bridge the gap but says clueless things. Day-to-day: Attends Grinder gatherings awkwardly, takes notes, means well but doesn't get it.

**Test Answer Integration:**
- **Ratchet's War Story IS the test hint**: The hull breach scenario is EXACTLY Question #4 on the Gen-Ed test
- **The Answer**: "Patch the engine first—a dead engine kills everyone. Kitchen can wait."
- **How to slip it in**: Ratchet tells war stories casually. PCs who listen to Grinders get the answer without realizing it's a test question.

**Player Engagement:**
- Loami will feel at home here (fellow Grinders recognize one of their own)
- Shows the class divide—these folks keep Vumbua running but get no glory
- Theorem's awkwardness could be relatable or cringe
- Practical wisdom: Grinders know how things ACTUALLY work, not how manuals say they work

---

### Optional Encounter: Finding Rill
**Location:** Fungal Research Labs (Block 12, Academic District)  
**NPCs (2-3):**

- **Rill** (Mizizi/secretly Wadi researcher, always studying)
- **Professor Ink** (Fungal biology specialist)
- **[[Dean Isolde Vane]]** (possibly, if she's checking on research progress)

**How to Find Her:**
Rill is NOT at the bonfire—she's *always* studying. If Britt/Aggie (or curious PCs) ask around about "the other Mizizi," students will point them to the Fungal Labs.

**The Scene:**
Rill is deep in research, surrounded by glowing spore samples and resonance equipment. She's documenting something about "Weeping Nodes" when the PCs arrive.

- **Rill**: (Looking up, surprised) "You're... the new forest-kin. I heard you'd arrived."
- (If Britt/Aggie): "I know what they say about me. The 'traitor.' But I left to *save* the forest, not abandon it."
- **Rill**: "Tomorrow's test—there's a question about Resonance Nodes. If it's *weeping*, don't use Standard Protocol. Don't cure sadness with a hammer. You have to *cry with it*. Understand?"

**Player Engagement:**
- Only available if PCs actively seek Rill out (skip bonfire socializing)
- Direct access to the Resonance Node hint (Question #2)
- Opportunity to learn more about Rill's research and motivations
- Dean Isolde might be present, adding tension/authority
- **Hint Drop**: "Cry with it" is the answer to Question #2


---

## Scene 1: The Bonfire (Block 99)

**Setting**:
- A makeshift gathering in the "industrial" sector (Block 99).
- The "Bonfire" is a burning pile of construction scraps in a pit, lit by chemical accelerants (or maybe a young Ash-Blood showing off—though with only ~200 [[Ash-Bloods]] at the Academy, that would draw a crowd).
- About 150-200 students gathered, mostly first-years with some upperclassmen.

**Key Dynamic**:
The PCs (especially [[Ignatius]], [[Britt]], and [[Aggie]]) will likely attract attention simply for being clan members. Among 70,000 students, perhaps only a few hundred are from the clans—making them exotic curiosities to most Harmony citizens.

**Key NPCs & Encounters**:
See **The Bonfire Hooks** section above for detailed encounter groups:
1. The Speculators' Debate ([[Percival Vane-Smythe III|Percy]], [[Iron-Jaw Jax|Jax]], [[Bramble]], [[Zephyr]])
2. [[Lucky]]'s Scam Operation (Lucky, [[Sarge]], [[Pudge]])
3. Serra's Fire Pit (Serra, Cassius, Silas)
4. The Legacy Table (Val, Glimmer, [[Kindle]], [[Mira]])
5. The Grinder's Truth ([[Ratchet]], [[Brawn]], Celia, [[Theorem]])

**Additional Encounters**:
- **Seraphina "Serra" Vox**: Hiding her family identity, eager to learn about the clans. She'll seek out Ignatius/Britt/Aggie to ask (possibly insensitive) questions.
- **Curious Onlookers**: Students may circle the PCs, asking questions like "Do you really eat rocks?" or "Can I smoke your moss?"—treating them like celebrities or specimens.
- **The Two Factions**: Watch for the ideological divide at the bonfire:
    - *The Harmony Loyalists*: Students who genuinely believe in the Academy's mission of integration and unity.
    - *The Skeptics*: Those who are here for opportunity but don't fully buy into Harmony propaganda.
- **The Zephyr Rumor**: Some students whisper about a weird incident during intake:
    - "Did you see that girl with the static? The one who kept crackling?"
    - "She refused to take the exam, just sat there babbling in some language no one understood."
    - "Then the DEAN herself came down and took the exam WITH her, like they were old friends or something."
    - "I saw them leave together afterward. [[Dean Isolde Vane|The Dean]] took her somewhere. Probably the fungal labs?"
    - "Wait—isn't that HER over there by the fire? How did she get out?"
    - "She's definitely some kind of clan member, right? But which one? She didn't look like Ash-Blood or [[Mizizi]]..."
    - This creates mystery and makes Zephyr a person of interest to observant PCs
    - **GM Note**: Zephyr got bored with [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Isolde]] and [[Rill]] studying/talking, so she snuck out to see what the bonfire was about

## Scene 2: The Semester Montage (Weeks 1-4)

**Concept**: A narrative montage covering the first month of classes. Players describe one key moment of their studies.

**Mechanic: Focus & Describe**
1.  **Choose a Focus**: Pick a Skill or Domain (e.g., Piloting, Arcana, Skullduggery).
2.  **Describe a Moment**: Narrate a scene of struggle, breakthrough, or trouble.
3.  **The Roll**: Make an Action Roll (Stat + 2d12).

**Outcomes**:
-   **Success with Hope**: **Top of the Class**. Gain a temporary **Experience** (e.g., *"Aced the Midterm"*) usable once during the Exam.
-   **Success with Fear**: **Passed, but...**: You passed, but attracted unwanted attention or owe a favor.
-   **Failure with Hope**: **Hard Lesson**: You failed the specific task, but learned from it. Clear 1 Stress or gain a **Hope**.
-   **Failure with Fear**: **Academic Probation**: The Professor hates you. Mark a Condition (e.g., *Stressed* or *Insecure*).

## Scene 3: Gen-Ed - Exploration 101 (The Written Assessment)

**Setting**:
- A massive "Exam Hall" with thousands of clacking brass terminals.
- **[[Dean Isolde Vane]]** presides from a floating podium.

**The Assessment**:
**The Assessment**:
- Players take the "Final Venture Exam" (the JSON survey) as a literal **10-question written test**.
- **Mechanic**:
    -   recall hints from Bonfire.
    -   **Savant Answer (10 pts)**: Riskier but "Real".
    -   **Textbook Answer (7 pts)**: Safe/Harmony standard.
- The default "harmony" answers are technically correct, but the "Savant" answers show you know the *reality* of the world (e.g. Steam powered by Crystal Batteries = Arcane Tech).

**The Twist**:
- Mid-exam, the screens glitch. A "Live Feed" from a real explorer pops up, showing something terrifying (a void-beast? a total wipeout?) before being cut. [[Dean Isolde Vane|The Dean]] claims it was "Part of the stress test".

## Scene 4: Practical Assessment - "The Simulations" (Afternoon)

**Setting**:
- The "Prove-It Grounds" and "Sim-Pods".
- Instructors: **Sergeant Kael** and **Professor Aris**.

**The Activity (Dice Rolls from Survey)**:
1.  **Aether-Graph Plot (Agility)**: Plotting navigation in a non-Euclidean archipelago.
    -   *[[Iggy]]'s Secret*: The shapes make sense to him (+2 Bonus).
2.  **The Density Chamber (Constitution/Strength)**: Surviving 400% gravity.
    -   *Iggy's Secret*: He's used to deep pressure (+2 Bonus).
3.  **The Blind Fly (Instinct)**: Landing a ship with no visibility.
    -   *Loami's Secret*: Feel the gears, don't look (+4 Bonus).
4.  **The Tuning Injection (Tech/Dexterity)**: Stabilizing a vibrating crystal.
    -   *Loami's Secret*: Inject the internal core, not the surface.

**Mechanics**:
- Roll the corresponding stats.
- **Success**: "Butter-smooth landing" / "Perfect Plot".
- **Partial**: "Controlled Crash".
- **Fail**: "Fire and Ash".

## World Building Details

**Food & Drink**:
- *Bonfire Snacks*: "Magma-Pop" (spicy popcorn cooked on Ash-Blood skin), "Fungal-Chips" ([[Mizizi]] snacks, widely popular), "Engine-Hooch" (strong, oily alcohol).
- *Academy Food*: "Nutri-Paste" (efficient, bland) vs "Captain's Table" (real food for high ranks).

**Music & Culture**:
- *Music*: Rhythmic, industrial beats ("Clank-Step") mixed with ethereal wind-chime sounds (Harmony traditional).
- *Fashion*: High-contrast. Wealthy students wear "Clean-Suits" (pristine white/gold). Workers/Clans wear "Tech-Wear" (utility belts, goggles, patches).

**Slang**:
- "Glitch" (someone acting weird/crazy).
- "Sparkless" (boring/uninspired).
- "Void-Touched" (creepy/lucky).

## Decisions & Clarifications

1.  **Factions/Harmony**:
    - *Definition*: Harmony is the "Ruling Coalition" or "The Sixth Clan" (Direction). Includes the Great Families (Vox, Vane, Sterling).
    - *Action*: Create `docs/lore/factions/harmony.md` to define these families.

2.  **Timekeeping**:
    - *Decision*: Hard clock times for Academy (regimented, industrial).

3.  **Names**:
    - *Decision*: "[[Ignatius]] of Magma" is a pretentious title. [[Rill]] is the only other [[Mizizi]].

4.  **Tech Level**:
    - *Clarification*: **Crystal-Punk**. Common tech is Steam/Mechanical, but the *energy source* is Harmony Crystal Batteries (Arcane-like).
    - *Visual*: Glowing blue crystals slotted into brass boilers.

5.  **Gen-Ed Test**:
    - *Format*: 10-question written test (Morning) followed by Practical Sims (Afternoon).
