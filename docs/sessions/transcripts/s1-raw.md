## Session **1** \- Transcript

### 00:00:00

   
**John Hagey:** similar to what I would call a like a hyperbole of some Hawaiian sentiment of like some Hawaiians still are culturally more Hawaiian than they are American and still to this day will like to this day will they'll be like oh we're being  
**GM or Aggie:** Mhm.  
**John Hagey:** like you know like we're we're more we're Hawaiian we're not American versus like you  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** know that's kind of how he sees it where he's like he's in this he's not a fanatic but he's definitely in this like cultural schism of like he's very cultural tied to like the the Ash Blood clan and the islands and stuff and wants there to be like an independence for themselves but at the same time like so yeah he's curious I'm like why did all the elders leave like why did like like he sees it as a partnership not he he wants the relationship to be a partnership he doesn't want the relationship to be like they're supplying resources and getting taken advantage of if that makes sense.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Okay. To me it sounds like if Go  
   
 

### 00:00:59

   
**John Hagey:** And and to be clear, he doesn't know the full picture.  
**GM or Aggie:** ahead.  
**John Hagey:** This is like your classic like teenager who has very strong political ideals who doesn't really know how the world  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Yeah. Okay.  
**John Hagey:** works.  
**GM or Aggie:** I think even so um when before the elders left they would have had they would have like addressed the clan and if he would have gone to that and listened at all the the general feeling is that um the the clan like elder the the high the the matriarch her name is uh Ignis and now she's Lady Ignis and she is now apparently someone extremely important in harmony. like overnight she became there was attendance, she had staff, she was given a airship, she was given a like a sea vessel, she was given an iron walker. Um like anything that she she wanted came and and and you I think you have a lot of respect for Lady Ignis. Like she's always been um a good leader of the clan. So, she she would have said to everyone like,  
   
 

### 00:02:02

   
**John Hagey:** right?  
**GM or Aggie:** um, I'm going to make sure that we are respected. And we'll maybe leave it there because there there's a couple other things she would have said, but I don't know if he would have caught them yet. So, we can see how how his character kind of plays out. But um that that has kind of given like Ignatius and any Ashb Blood a quasi uh famous status lately. Like if you say you're from the clans because it's a very cosmopol cosmopolitan world.  
**Loami or Britt:** There you can.  
**GM or Aggie:** The only way that they would know is maybe by like your accent or your mannerisms. Um or maybe like the things you wear,  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** stuff like that. But it's not they're not going to look at you and immediately like, "Oh, that's the only only Ember can I've ever seen in my entire life." Um, it might be you might be more there was definitely more immune in the volcanoes than otherwise. Even you had exchanges from other other clans and it's it's still pretty cosmopolitan.  
   
 

### 00:03:01

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um, so, uh, yeah, but I I think the other thing that you saw is like they made a big deal when when the Harmony folks came and before Lady Ignis left there, they made there was this big like ceremony where they took a um an like one of the Obsidian stones and they used it to like you've always done your whole life, put it underneath the grill, slab of meat on it and cook it like a, you know,  
**Loami or Britt:** It's  
**GM or Aggie:** grill. And they did the same thing in the volcano with one of their harmony batteries,  
**Loami or Britt:** interesting.  
**GM or Aggie:** the little crystal gems powering an electric cooker, and they slapped a a grill and they ate with both of those pieces of meat. So  
**John Hagey:** This is the This is the equivalent of using like a black stone and then like using those like new convection like things that look like the  
**GM or Aggie:** yeah, exactly. Exactly.  
**John Hagey:** countertop.  
**GM or Aggie:** So that that for but and so when that happened and they take that they took that first bite um you you the volcano like almost erupted it it just got so hot and got it came beca it became alive again it felt like to you the way that you've always been told as soon as that that thing that like moment happened or thereabouts throughout the night of this party when when these things were cooking that seemed to be  
   
 

### 00:04:14

   
**Loami or Britt:** Wow.  
**GM or Aggie:** a really significant moment um and maybe you would even learn that like  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** that I don't know would that have been something he was trying to dig in like why is why is this such a thing? Why did the volcano react this way?  
**John Hagey:** Yeah,  
**Loami or Britt:** Whisper.  
**John Hagey:** I think that's like a a curiosity and like a driving factor, I guess.  
**GM or Aggie:** So, all that you would have probably been able to put in without, you know, maybe us rolling necessarily already, but um all that you would have been able to pick up is that um this is  
**Loami or Britt:** How's it  
**GM or Aggie:** like they call these the stitching that this was like a stitching event and it it formally  
**Loami or Britt:** look?  
**GM or Aggie:** integrated the Ash Bloods into Harmony as like basically a full citizen. Um, and there is there is an actual connection that happens between harmony and the power that powers like the volcanic aisle that you live in. Bless you. So, um,  
**John Hagey:** Thank you.  
**GM or Aggie:** that was like a huge event for everyone who was in attendance.  
   
 

### 00:05:15

   
**GM or Aggie:** There was people like crying from Harmony. It was it was very significant for them. Um and then that is that became like ladiness then became um a after that one of the most important people that it seems like you've ever everyone was just so respectful and she was getting like a lot more attention after that. Cool. Um Sophie, how much did you catch before I remember where I got to uh rail?  
**Loami or Britt:** Um,  
**GM or Aggie:** I was about to talk about rail I think.  
**Loami or Britt:** yeah. All the way past. Yeah. Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. So, real wasn't fitting in, very depressed. Um,  
**Loami or Britt:** And  
**GM or Aggie:** when Harmony came to the shore, the first explorer came and it was a very different experience from the ash blood where the the guy who found your island, John, was or um was there all the way through that ceremony. Um, actually, it was it was a it was a lady. It was um the woman who the adventure woman who found your island was there the entire time.  
   
 

### 00:06:14

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um and then only left after the integration and she left she left with uh Lady Ignis to go back to the you know wherever she came from you don't know somewhere to the east and  
**John Hagey:** Did they have a  
**GM or Aggie:** she Yeah it's Captain Aara um  
**John Hagey:** name?  
**GM or Aggie:** Thorne  
**John Hagey:** All where have I heard this name before?  
**GM or Aggie:** Oh yeah gosh every time I always forget. Yeah, you need a random number generator. A random name generator.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** 10 out of 10 times. Um, so yeah, she she her and Lady N went to Harmony together, like she escorted Lady N's new vessel. She had a like dope new airship that she got to fly. Um, by contrasting that to the Mazi where the guy who found your place, um, he was he was pretty like pompous, kind of kind of arrogant and he was only there for like a day and then looked around, clearly was confused the entire time he was there and not able to like he saw him talk to the elders and he just walked out scratching his head and then he just shrugged and took his ship and and left.  
   
 

### 00:07:26

   
**GM or Aggie:** And like two months later, a whole bunch more people came and um have since been trying to like take samples and exchanging the weapons that you've been needing to um like, you know, deal with the forest. So, um but once once he came and and the second wave came, real left. She left the forest. one of the first people to leave the forest. And um I she she has sent letters back to the clan at some point just saying that she  
**Loami or Britt:** H.  
**GM or Aggie:** she found um she's on the hunt for answers of why we are the way we are. She's sorry. If anyone ever leaves, come find her. She would love to, you know,  
**Loami or Britt:** Hm.  
**GM or Aggie:** like talk more.  
**Loami or Britt:** So, did Wait, did we know that she was uh an exchange or you said that we maybe don't know who exchanges and who doesn't or who  
**GM or Aggie:** Right. She came two years ago, so it would be Was she a turtle mushroom?  
**Loami or Britt:** isn't?  
**GM or Aggie:** She um I don't know.  
   
 

### 00:08:27

   
**GM or Aggie:** I feel like she was not a turtle mushroom, but big enough that like you could have it's it's big enough that you wouldn't have you wouldn't know everyone who lives there,  
**Loami or Britt:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** but it would still be sort of like significant when someone new came.  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay. So, you would know that they weren't there the whole time and yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** Right. Yeah, you would definitely know they like and just she was she stuck out like a sore thumb.  
**Loami or Britt:** you could.  
**GM or Aggie:** She just she really didn't um didn't like being there it seemed  
**Loami or Britt:** Cool.  
**GM or Aggie:** like.  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Uh sweet. any other and then for for Lomi the the important bits that you know is that um Harmony is it didn't teleport it is it is kind of like um there's these two main vessels like a huge basically like an ironclide cruise ship and a massive airship and they uh they like dock together to make up the core of whatever Vimula is whatever the they where wherever the academy is they are like the core and they don't move a lot but like every 50 years they move to a new location and so Lomi is not that old so it's always been in one place for him.  
   
 

### 00:09:41

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um and I'll show youall I can actually just show you the map right now. Um so this is kind of your world map. Um, so you came from this continent over here,  
**Loami or Britt:** Oh.  
**GM or Aggie:** uh, which is like where Octoumba is. That's where the previous version of Vimila was,  
**Loami or Britt:** Oh,  
**GM or Aggie:** which is like the the England island  
**Loami or Britt:** this is so helpful actually. Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** basically. Uh  
**Loami or Britt:** Gotcha. So harmony does not move just the university or  
**GM or Aggie:** um it's it's well known that the islands over a long long long  
**Loami or Britt:** academy.  
**GM or Aggie:** time move towards each other. Like in a hundred years an island could move a whole mile. Just like significant amount of movement.  
**Loami or Britt:** Gotcha. Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** You wouldn't building bridges is kind of a tricky thing. Um, but as long as the land mass is connected, it doesn't get it doesn't change shape or anything like  
**Loami or Britt:** Gotcha.  
**GM or Aggie:** that.  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:10:54

   
**GM or Aggie:** Like I think you know this this island here what used to be a lot f you know 10,000 years ago is would have been a couple miles further away from shore than it is now.  
**Loami or Britt:** Gotcha. Sick. This is awesome.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, and then I also have this version of the map which I I don't remember which one I liked more, but one of them is tied to like your persons and where they've been, and the other one's like a global reveal. So, I might go back and forth depending on how maintainable they both are.  
**Loami or Britt:** Gotcha.  
**GM or Aggie:** You should be able to see pretty much the same  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** information.  
**Loami or Britt:** Mhm. Definitely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. All righty. Good. Good. Little bit of that help a little bit.  
**Loami or Britt:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** That's kind of I'm taking a little different approach.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** I'm trying to uh build the world and I have I have like I have no session six planned.  
   
 

### 00:11:57

   
**GM or Aggie:** I have like one thing that I think is really cool and we'll see how it happens. And then I have another thing that I think is cool and we'll see what happens.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** A little bit more sandboxy than the last  
**Loami or Britt:** I love it.  
**GM or Aggie:** ones.  
**John Hagey:** You're just using us because this whole thing is an uncharted map and that just allows you to chart the map as we adventure it.  
**GM or Aggie:** That's true.  
**Loami or Britt:** I gotta take a picture of this  
**GM or Aggie:** What's your point?  
**John Hagey:** Such a such a such a DM  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah, what's your point?  
**Loami or Britt:** story.  
**John Hagey:** move.  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh, okay. So that said, um then what getting back to where we were, the um what would have happened for all of you is how every different way you made it into Bombua, the the city of the academy. um you uh like the Mizi, the Ash Bloods specifically, and Lomi, you know, like it's it's the academy is open registration. Anyone can can apply to go to the academy, but you only get to do it one time.  
   
 

### 00:13:08

   
**GM or Aggie:** And to to find the academy and to get there is the first test. And it's not a hard test, but it does mean you have to get on a little adventure. If you are on the far side of Harmony and you wanted to be an adventurer, you got to show that you can get there. It's not that hard. Book a flight, book a passage. But um there is no online application. It's be there on the date to take the grant, to take the exam, the entrance exam. And for some people, for 20,000 people, that was it. And they got sent back. Their one shot of their entire life didn't pan out. Um, and part of the reason this class is so big is because for like especially Lomi would know, um, there hasn't been any new major discoveries in a while. And discoveries are usually of two types in harmony's history. Something that like a land which had sentient beings on it. Um, or a just a unique biome that seemed to have a special property.  
   
 

### 00:14:06

   
**GM or Aggie:** And I don't know that Lomi knows much about like the underlying mechanics of the world. So that's kind of probably as much as he would know and he would know the most. Um, but there's not been like a grand new discovery in a long time. So the the finding of two clans each with their own different like magical energy and they both have you know people living there is is reviving the century old like nothing has happened for a really long time and it's been it's been a really long time. It's been like a thousand years since any real civilization was found. The only things recently were like one or two bones of people had been found. So you could tell there used to be civilization there, but there's not there anymore. So it's a really big and and because of that, it's it's caused this huge resurgent in like resurgence in wanting to be an explorer. So tons of people have flooded to this intake exam because they realize like the frontier has just been breached.  
   
 

### 00:15:02

   
**GM or Aggie:** This is your best chance because if you can get that rank of explore or not, it's it's equivalent to being like an NFL star, a bull rider, like you are you are a celebrity. Your life is set. you're going to get a stipen from the government the rest of your life. Um, but you gota you got to earn it and you only get one chance. So most people like hedge that bet as long as possible until there's a chance that like there's more openings, there's more places to explore. That's why this is so exciting. Um, and also why you're getting people who are, you know, 600y old elves coming to this because they haven't there's been nothing, you know, really worth doing for them in their whole life. And there's also like youths of 10 or 20 years, whatever. Um, so getting to the exam is pretty easy. There's these massive hangers that are being built to hold all the adventuring fleet, but in the meantime, they're here to hold students. And there's just tons of cubicles set up all through these hangar floors.  
   
 

### 00:16:02

   
**GM or Aggie:** and the flow of of civilization just pulls you in its wake very easily to where the tests are being taken. And you just see stapled across the um there's like eight of these things in a row across the harbor front that uh almost act as like a gateway into behind where you can kind of see a bunch of cranes and towers poking up and spires starting to rise from what seem to be the new academy grounds that are being built. um but these are almost acting as century between you and them. And so that first test that you took um which gave you your rank, the way that that happened was you were brought into this cubicle sat down by um basically like a butler figure and there's just it's just a bunch of attendants running around in these sort of teal um like butler ties and um sort of like somewhere between sultan and English uh that type of of attendant. and the machine in front of you would have printed out like that first question all the way up until begin intake.  
   
 

### 00:17:07

   
**GM or Aggie:** And then you click a button on the keyboard and the next question would come out and it just prints the receipt. That's like the monitor on how the the exam is interacting with you. Um and so as you were going through your questions, it would print out the next question. It would wait. You'd click the matching symbol on the keyboard. You didn't have to like know how to use the typewriter. You just look down and say, "Okay, question number four is four." Click. Number three is three. Click. And then eventually you get to the end where it it prints out that rank that you got like gold, silver, copper, rust, and then cuts it off and drops and then that floats into your hand. A little flag pings up on the corner and suddenly an attendant was there to whisk you away and clear the cubicle. And that just is all happening all around you. There's these little flags ping ping and just tons of movement and noise.  
**Loami or Britt:** What?  
   
 

### 00:17:58

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um and then so we we can pause there if anyone feels like they uh like especially the ZZ this is a sea of people uh if you have I'm curious like see feeling like what this or seeing like this but it felt like that change your first impressions of uh of the city or is it or how they're approaching like the next steps or is just being pulled in the  
**Loami or Britt:** I mean, I  
**GM or Aggie:** in the current. Yeah.  
**Loami or Britt:** think  
**GM or Aggie:** Like just kind of bumblebee bumbling along with going with the current. It's not like the most graceful, but yeah, just kind of getting Gotcha. She doesn't know where to go. Yeah. Fair. What about Brent?  
**Loami or Britt:** I think Brit is a little bit more like sure-footed and like a little bit more still sort of being swept along with the crowd because how could you not? There's just so many people. But I think definitely not like getting bounced around like she's like she's holding her own.  
**GM or Aggie:** Cool.  
   
 

### 00:19:03

   
**Loami or Britt:** Her feet are steady.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, do y'all do y'all stay together though? Like the two of you? Do you stay linked or do you find yourself separated?  
**Loami or Britt:** I think we try to stay together. I don't know if we do, but I think we  
**GM or Aggie:** I do.  
**Loami or Britt:** try.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Yeah. I I think it's pretty reasonable that y'all could stay together. what I'm what the tricky thing though um and uh even I still kind of need to learn all of the different like skills and stuff but um I might have y'all roll like a maybe like an instinct. So that's the ins on the character sheet. I just click on it. Yeah. And then it'll ask you a bunch of questions  
**Loami or Britt:** Should I get a dice?  
**GM or Aggie:** roll.  
**Loami or Britt:** I think Brit is throwing some bows as needed also just to like make it  
**GM or Aggie:** Nice, nice, nice.  
**Loami or Britt:** through the crowd.  
**GM or Aggie:** Six with hope. Pretty lows.  
   
 

### 00:20:06

   
**GM or Aggie:** Pretty lows.  
**Loami or Britt:** Nice.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. 10 with  
**Loami or Britt:** With hope.  
**GM or Aggie:** hope.  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay. So whenever you roll with hope, do you like mark one or is it only if you  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh yeah. Yeah. You So the currency comes it might do it already for you.  
**Loami or Britt:** succeed?  
**GM or Aggie:** Is that supposed to be this one up here? Yeah.  
**Loami or Britt:** Let's  
**GM or Aggie:** So, there's hope across the top and then there's Click on it to get it to Yeah.  
**Loami or Britt:** see.  
**GM or Aggie:** I thought it might have already done it for you. I didn't really test. There were already two on mine.  
**Loami or Britt:** It's here.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. And it did not change with that roll. Okay. I see three on yours now.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** I just clicked. Okay. Got it. Cool. Okay. Yeah. So, we're gonna we're going to figure this out together. Um, so a couple a quick thing about the character sheet since yall haven't had a chance to look at it yet.  
   
 

### 00:20:39

   
**Loami or Britt:** Cool.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, you you have six core skills and those are your same like major stats just like D and D. Um, but you have no subsklls.  
**Loami or Britt:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** There's no persuasion, perception, um, like deception, all of those, they just roll up into the core skill. Instead, you have experiences, which are in the bottom left of the character sheet, and those are kind of things that you got from the way you answered your survey. And these are these can grow over time. So you get better at very specific things and they try to like anchor the experiences on your actual backstory instead of being a generic list of skills.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah, that's cool.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um you also um there's also a couple  
**Loami or Britt:** I like it.  
**GM or Aggie:** of of things that you can do in and around your character sheet like you have your equipment which has some  
**John Hagey:** I  
**GM or Aggie:** basic like weapons and stuff. That's pretty simple. your load out. This is um Daggerheart abstracts all of the differences between the classes into just you're supposed to have like a deck of cards and each skill is a card.  
   
 

### 00:21:57

   
**GM or Aggie:** And all of these cards use like one of two economies, stress or a token that you like put on your character sheet for that session. And  
**John Hagey:** killed my guy. Sorry. I killed my guy. I did not realize that the HP being zero was a good  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Yeah. I do hate that.  
**Loami or Britt:** Bye.  
**John Hagey:** thing.  
**GM or Aggie:** I do hate that.  
**Loami or Britt:** See you next time,  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. RIP.  
**John Hagey:** I'll see you guys  
**Loami or Britt:** John.  
**John Hagey:** later.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, so you can see that like sometimes you'll be spending hope to do something. So like the the one of the cool things about the dice builds the economy.  
**Loami or Britt:** Oh,  
**GM or Aggie:** If you roll well,  
**Loami or Britt:** okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** you get more things that you can do. If you roll poorly, that gives fear. and fear is is my economy. So that's how like we don't use initiative. It's just once someone rolls with fear, I get to go.  
   
 

### 00:22:46

   
**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um and then to do special attacks or whatever that is um that stuff I spin spend fear to do.  
**Loami or Britt:** And  
**GM or Aggie:** And on the bottom you should have like somewhere a skulls floating on your  
**Loami or Britt:** then  
**GM or Aggie:** map. Um Oh yeah.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** So you can see like that's the that's the fear counter. So that gives you an idea of of how much the world is building karma against  
**Loami or Britt:** feared us.  
**GM or Aggie:** you basically.  
**Loami or Britt:** That  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh so like right now you're you're at you're at zero fear which is great because means you don't have to be nervous about me me spending three fear to like take your head points with a poison that you ate or something like that. Um, but that's kind of like the the asymmetry. Um, so yeah. So you roll with fear, I get stuff. You roll with hope, you get stuff. And then you can always spin stress. So stress is kind of like your exhaustion tracker in D\&D.  
   
 

### 00:23:49

   
**GM or Aggie:** That's right next to your hit points on your map.  
**Loami or Britt:** Oh yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** You should have two, like you're already stress.  
**Loami or Britt:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** That's like the starting point of just being alive. Um, and yeah.  
**Loami or Britt:** Retweet.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yep. Right. Uh, and those I think those reset at a uh you can do like a a short rest to re to reset some of it and a long rest to reset more of it.  
**Loami or Britt:** Cool. So,  
**GM or Aggie:** Cool.  
**Loami or Britt:** this is so fun. Thanks,  
**GM or Aggie:** New mechanics. We all love them.  
**Loami or Britt:** Luke.  
**GM or Aggie:** You It's got to be complicated enough that you don't get it or like you can add to it but not so complicated you're like what the hell am I doing here?  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, cool.  
**Holly Strebel:** me.  
**GM or Aggie:** I think that's the big stuff about your car sheet. Any any questions? Anybody have a skill that they don't understand? What's the difference between the loadout and the vault?  
   
 

### 00:24:35

   
**Holly Strebel:** Oh,  
**GM or Aggie:** The load out. The vault is like once you have more cards, you might have skills that aren't active. So, the vault would be the inactive. Yeah. Best I understand it. I was like,  
**Holly Strebel:** heat.  
**GM or Aggie:** "Send to vault." And I was like, "What?" Yeah. Yeah. So that's like yeah archive it or not active right now. So after this what I'll have you all do is if you click the plus by the load out it should give you a browse companion button. Does it do that forward? Uh on loadout there'll be a plus and then browse companion.  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. So I'll have y'all go and pick your cards. You get to pick two. I just gave you two to start. You can leave them. I thought they were two good ones generally for each of you. Um but you can choose whatever ones you want.  
**Loami or Britt:** Guys,  
**GM or Aggie:** And if you want to swap it out as we're going, that's fine, too.  
   
 

### 00:25:25

   
**Loami or Britt:** nothing.  
**GM or Aggie:** So, that's one thing. Um, and then the second thing, I didn't give any of you a subclass. The same thing, if you click the subclass at the very top, it'll be right underneath your name. It's scratched out with a line. Then you can decide which of the two subasses are more interesting, and you'll just drag that onto your character sheet. Is there a description of them or Yeah, if you click it, it'll explain it. Okay.  
**Loami or Britt:** Well,  
**Holly Strebel:** Wait, sorry. I'm not seeing the subclass thing.  
**GM or Aggie:** You see the um at the top?  
**Holly Strebel:** Oh, there. Yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** yeah, yeah, yeah. I got  
**GM or Aggie:** So, those are the two customizations that I left you all.  
**Holly Strebel:** it.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um really just one that you have to do and one that you can't do.  
**Loami or Britt:** Sorry. Oh,  
**Holly Strebel:** So,  
**Loami or Britt:** you got a lot to choose.  
**Holly Strebel:** we're supposed to have four of the cards and you only gave it you gave us  
   
 

### 00:26:15

   
**Loami or Britt:** Oh,  
**GM or Aggie:** You're supposed to no only two.  
**Loami or Britt:** that I can add  
**Holly Strebel:** two.  
**GM or Aggie:** So, you can remove one.  
**Holly Strebel:** Oh,  
**Loami or Britt:** to  
**Holly Strebel:** got it.  
**GM or Aggie:** You can leave it as as it is right now.  
**Holly Strebel:** Got it.  
**GM or Aggie:** That's really fine. Um, also,  
**Loami or Britt:** I think Syndicate actually my instinct  
**GM or Aggie:** uh, your stats, you can have,  
**Loami or Britt:** is  
**GM or Aggie:** um, if you click the wrench by the stats,  
**Loami or Britt:** got a little symbol. Uh, all right.  
**GM or Aggie:** if you go to like the tab,  
**Loami or Britt:** Let's  
**GM or Aggie:** maybe  
**Loami or Britt:** interesting.  
**GM or Aggie:** weird. No way you can't do that.  
**Loami or Britt:** This is like awful.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um give  
**Loami or Britt:** Awful. Yeah, it's true.  
**GM or Aggie:** you so which we give one plus two oneus two plus  
**Loami or Britt:** For him as well.  
**GM or Aggie:** one which you want them two two  
**Loami or Britt:** The vibe is very like  
**GM or Aggie:** one.  
**Loami or Britt:** top.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Loami or Britt:** Let's see  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:27:19

   
**GM or Aggie:** let y'all kind of Yeah,  
**Loami or Britt:** this.  
**GM or Aggie:** that sounds then everyone should have um on their stats. The default stats are you get a plus two, two plus ones and one minus one.  
**Loami or Britt:** There we go.  
**GM or Aggie:** So you should be seeing that for your your core stats and that was just given to you by the um survey as you filled it out.  
**Loami or Britt:** Sweet. Cool.  
**GM or Aggie:** remix to ignition. Fresh out the  
**Holly Strebel:** Okay.  
**Loami or Britt:** What's ages  
**GM or Aggie:** kitchen. Um, okay. So, then yeah. So, let's go. So, y'all rolled y'all rolled. Um, I think Brit, you would have finished your survey first and so you would have been pulled from the cubicle and if you wanted to try to like stall for um, Aggie to finish her her test, then you can. Otherwise, like y'all are going to get pulled apart in the current end.  
**Loami or Britt:** I think uh I think I try to stall. Yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Um, how do you do that?  
   
 

### 00:28:30

   
**Loami or Britt:** I think I'm I think that I So, as I finish the the little flag automatically goes ding.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yep.  
**Loami or Britt:** I think I um Can I grab the flag and just like hold it back down?  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Do you are you gonna try to do it as before it's going up or just now that it's you're reaching and trying to knock it down?  
**Loami or Britt:** I I would love to say that Brit is um taking everything in enough to realize that as people finish the there's dinging happening and so she's kind of  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Loami or Britt:** like anticipating and like ready to try to grab it before it pops  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay.  
**Loami or Britt:** up.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. So, um this is one of those things it's like in Dagger Hart they really try to not let try to have as few roles as possible and so something like this I just think that it happens.  
**Loami or Britt:** Interesting.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, and the only question is like how the world replies to it.  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** And I rolled pretty good on my side because I can roll as much as I want because it doesn't contribute to anyone's economy basically.  
   
 

### 00:29:39

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um,  
**Loami or Britt:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** I think that like you you were able to get it down and that meant that the the first person didn't get you, but the next person coming you can see someone like it's like the airport attendant, you know, the airport guard, traffic guard. He's way down there on a point and he's looking at your car and he's walking to you and you can tell  
**Loami or Britt:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** that you're going to be the next car that gets the whistle blown at you and told to go around until pickup.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um,  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** so you've got a little second, but and I think you're looking at Aggie and she's still just kind of heads down going away. Um, so either your choices are like make a scene or uh be like do something else.  
**Loami or Britt:** Can I like try to rip my ticket off and shove it in my pocket and be like something happened like it like Yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** You can do that.  
**Loami or Britt:** it didn't print like the Bluetooth's not  
   
 

### 00:30:28

   
**GM or Aggie:** Uh okay.  
**Loami or Britt:** connected.  
**GM or Aggie:** So yeah, at that point like a guy comes and he's like um you finished your exam.  
**Loami or Britt:** I did,  
**GM or Aggie:** You um okay this way please come.  
**Loami or Britt:** but it didn't print.  
**GM or Aggie:** Impossible.  
**Loami or Britt:** No, it didn't print. It didn't print. Let me I'm going to look under the table.  
**GM or Aggie:** It  
**Loami or Britt:** And I just get down and start looking underneath. Just like shuffling around underneath the  
**GM or Aggie:** ma'am. Excuse me, ma'am. Um,  
**Loami or Britt:** desk.  
**GM or Aggie:** it really is time to go. Um, this cubicle needs to be cleared for the next candidate. Excuse me,  
**Loami or Britt:** It didn't print.  
**GM or Aggie:** ma'am.  
**Loami or Britt:** I think I I think I stand up and my shell hits the desk and it like knocks over the typewriter  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. I just feel like as soon as everything's chaotic over there, then mine goes ding. Yeah. Ding. Yeah. I like it. I like it.  
   
 

### 00:31:22

   
**Loami or Britt:** and then I pull it out of my pocket and I say,  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh  
**Loami or Britt:** "Oh, I found  
**GM or Aggie:** uh.  
**Loami or Britt:** it.  
**GM or Aggie:** Please,  
**John Hagey:** All right.  
**GM or Aggie:** please follow me, man. Please follow. You know, starts walking.  
**Loami or Britt:** I think I make eye contact with Aggie and I follow.  
**GM or Aggie:** I guess I just chase after. Okay. Yeah. So, you've got your um and an attendant kind of catches you and makes sure that you get your paper if you didn't already. Yeah. No, she totally stayed on. Yeah. So, a second one's like, "Man, ma'am, ma'am, excuse me, man." And she runs up and just like, uh, hands it to you. Uh, thanks. You're welcome. And then they run back into the crowd and are are immediately taken away into the chaos. Um, an exhausting exhausting role. There's a ton of these attendants. Like there's there's quite a lot, but there's still like thousands of people taking these tests at any one time.  
   
 

### 00:32:11

   
**Loami or Britt:** I  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. So y'all are able to to join back together into the flow and you eventually um head your way and like Lomi and Iggy and India like I don't I don't know that anything here is particularly impactful for y'all but if you want to pause and and take a moment to like ask ask a question or try to do anything uh this would be where y'all are kind of getting pulled through after taking your exams as  
**Loami or Britt:** think just during like the general stroll to the exam and like being shuffled away from the exam, Lomi's talking with the guy like, "Hey, there's quite a lot of you here. How how's you know, how's your benefits? How how's it you all right? Yeah. Everybody doing well? They they paying you well here?  
**GM or Aggie:** You are a copper. It is always good to know your options. I hope you make it through the next round. Um, I do you need a job? Are you are you looking for  
   
 

### 00:33:27

   
**Loami or Britt:** Ah, no.  
**GM or Aggie:** employment?  
**Loami or Britt:** I I got a life calling in uh in the boiler room, you know, family family born and raised boiler boiler mega union. And you know,  
**GM or Aggie:** Sorry. One second.  
**Loami or Britt:** you know,  
**GM or Aggie:** Sorry.  
**Loami or Britt:** this might take  
**GM or Aggie:** Come on, sir. Your test is done. You know,  
**Loami or Britt:** off.  
**GM or Aggie:** please please don't try it again. No, you can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's you just you have to. and you see like a different colored attendant and like slightly more bulky comes and grabs and the guy's just weeping as he gets pulled to the side and the guy said,  
**Loami or Britt:** own.  
**GM or Aggie:** "Oh, sorry about that. Um, you're talking about boiling water."  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah, you know, you you got you are doing great work here and you you keep doing your thing. Uh I see I see you're very busy. Uh just just want to make sure you're being taken care  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah,  
   
 

### 00:34:10

   
**Loami or Britt:** of.  
**GM or Aggie:** he's like I I think even at that point someone like he he ducks as someone try like throws uh like a hat or something off the tin and he says,  
**Loami or Britt:** b\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.  
**GM or Aggie:** "Oh gosh, um thank you for your concern. I uh if you have a god, please pray." And he goes to this, you see, he's going to like this eight foot tall like Goliath who's like, "No, no, a second try, please. This is my I need this for my family." And the guy, this little gnome, he's like,  
**John Hagey:** Why you make it so  
**GM or Aggie:** "Yeah, so sad." Um,  
**John Hagey:** sad?  
**GM or Aggie:** what the I know. And so as you're working your way through, like there's you about one in five is being pulled uh in a different direction than you. um their flags went up and it doesn't seem like the attendants are having um to like  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** there the the flags actually the flags aren't flipping up red or green  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay. Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** basically to get the to look at um but they're not checking your receipts  
   
 

### 00:35:09

   
**Loami or Britt:** That's what I was going to ask. Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** until you get to the end and I think like there's um uh there's quite a lot of people that you just see them pull it's like Costco they're pulling out their receipts and then there's two guys with a Sharpie who are checking it off Um, and they're these are more soldier type, not necessarily like um armored, but wearing thicker jerkens that are wrapped around um in like an intricate pattern and they just seem to have like a little bit of of leather padding under them. They they clearly are more hearty and they are acting as the gate like the Costco gatekeepers to let people out of the um out of like the past side of the warehouse.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** And so all of you have your receipts.  
**Loami or Britt:** gotcha.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um you will have they'll check it check it off and and pass you through uh unless there's any like other deviations. I think like y'all are  
**Holly Strebel:** I think Iggy is  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** um I I'm I think he's gonna ask like first of all Sardia the tissue I  
   
 

### 00:36:29

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um,  
**Holly Strebel:** really Yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** a tissue.  
**Holly Strebel:** I could I could use a  
**GM or Aggie:** I um  
**Holly Strebel:** tissue.  
**GM or Aggie:** I  
**Holly Strebel:** That's okay. That's okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** No.  
**Holly Strebel:** I have an idea. And then he goes up to the the receipt thing that's been printing and he just pulls  
**GM or Aggie:** Oh, no.  
**Loami or Britt:** Oh no. All  
**Holly Strebel:** down.  
**GM or Aggie:** Sorry.  
**Holly Strebel:** I got it. I got I got I got it. I got it.  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh,  
**Holly Strebel:** Okay,  
**Loami or Britt:** right.  
**Holly Strebel:** I have one more question. Where am I?  
**GM or Aggie:** oh god.  
**John Hagey:** Yes.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, that is that is just dropped our throughput by 100 candidates. This is um terrible. Terri and then you see like a a taller figure starts working their way through the con. Oh, um, that's my supervisor. Oh god. Uh, can you can you help me fix it? No, it's already gross. Oh, it's so gross.  
   
 

### 00:37:24

   
**GM or Aggie:** He's like picking up slime off of the like uh receipt generator and he's what do you where you're in the test? Go that way. Just please stay with the  
**Holly Strebel:** But I don't I don't know what this is.  
**GM or Aggie:** car  
**Holly Strebel:** I just Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** as he uh as does Iggy use his receipt at all?  
**Holly Strebel:** No,  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay.  
**Holly Strebel:** no,  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay.  
**Holly Strebel:** he did not use his  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah, I think even the attendance like um as he as Iggy's reaching in there, he might he might be looking for your receipt like you were you passed but you're so this and you oh my god um and he waves and a a much more tailored individual comes and and grabs Iggy by the arm and says, "Sir, this way towards the entrance. Welcome to Vimua." Uh yeah,  
**Holly Strebel:** Well, thank you so much  
**GM or Aggie:** absolutely no problem. Um, if there's any any questions, don't ask me, but keep them in and you they'll be answered.  
**Holly Strebel:** Well,  
**GM or Aggie:** Welcome to Curiosity.  
   
 

### 00:38:27

   
**Holly Strebel:** I do I do have  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh, good, good. That's what you're here for. And,  
**Holly Strebel:** questions.  
**GM or Aggie:** um, I'm sure you're going to have a great time finding the answers. Uh, and this is like that supervisor figure that came in after the he destroyed the cubicle. And um he uh the guards you can see there's this interaction as kind of being pulled through that uh you hand the receipt to the guard and the guard looks down looks at Iggy looks down looks at the supervisor. Supervisor shrugs and he's like the guard's all right good job lad pats you on the back and and kind of sends you through.  
**Holly Strebel:** Perfect.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Um Britt and um and Aggie, when y'all get to the gate, uh Brit, you get a little extra attention. They're uh they're like, "Oh, welcome. Welcome to Vamboua. Hope you have a great time and you learn a lot and you an adventure takes you to where your heart desires. Uh good luck." And they just kind of like actually make eye contact and acknowledge you a little  
   
 

### 00:39:35

   
**GM or Aggie:** bit. And the rest of you are are not really called out in any way. Um, okay.  
**Loami or Britt:** I think Brit is just like and then grabs Aggie and like  
**GM or Aggie:** So,  
**Loami or Britt:** continues walking.  
**GM or Aggie:** would um how would I how would Agie res um feel about Brit getting attention? I think she's just trying to be nice to everyone at this point, not piss anyone off. catch up. But also trying to like Yeah, just keep an eye out for anything that seems weirder than what everything we're seeing is. Yeah. Okay. Um, love it. So, as you exit the warehouses, you are um I forgot I have a transition for this. Um, you come through these large marble pillars through this gate into this huge courtyard where a monstrous uh ironclad cruise ship with brass fittings sits in a harbor. Next to it is like a smaller version of it that has like this airship balloon tied to it. And the people are just so small compared to these vehicles.  
   
 

### 00:40:53

   
**GM or Aggie:** like you you kind of are wondering how 80,000 people could fit into a university and it's because you can't see anything is why. Um thank  
**John Hagey:** It started so good.  
**GM or Aggie:** you.  
**John Hagey:** It started so good. It looked so cool for about two  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah, the transition.  
**John Hagey:** seconds.  
**GM or Aggie:** There we go.  
**Loami or Britt:** Nice.  
**GM or Aggie:** So yeah,  
**Loami or Britt:** So cool.  
**GM or Aggie:** the campus is huge and it's um got cranes and scaffolding thrown up  
**John Hagey:** That's  
**GM or Aggie:** all around it. It is it is an academy under construction. On the far side is this is is really the only complete building which has a do roof and large pillars and seems to be like where the flow is is parting around one of these two sides and then you can see people joining back on the other side. Yes.  
**John Hagey:** Is that one big ship with a bridge connecting them or is that two separate ships with a bridge connecting  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh,  
**John Hagey:** them?  
**GM or Aggie:** you want to roll me something to see how the what the hell you're processing here?  
   
 

### 00:41:57

   
**GM or Aggie:** Because I I don't think he's seen anything like this.  
**John Hagey:** Yes. I don't know what to roll though.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah, this is like kind of like call Cthulhu. I'm not supposed to tell you. You're supposed to choose and tell me why you chose.  
**Loami or Britt:** Oh. W  
**GM or Aggie:** So looking at Ignatius like Yeah. Okay. He chose Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** I think that I don't know if I meant to roll two things, but I  
**GM or Aggie:** So you gave him my you gave you gave the first fear role and then nine with  
**John Hagey:** did.  
**GM or Aggie:** fear.  
**Loami or Britt:** that checks out to be honest though like walking into  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Loami or Britt:** this  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. And I think as we get better of it, like that you're supposed to play off of the hope with fear on on the responses too. And like that gives you a little bit more um with one number you get a lot more variety.  
**Loami or Britt:** Cool.  
**GM or Aggie:** Oh, also uh doubles are crits.  
   
 

### 00:42:45

   
**GM or Aggie:** Any double is a crit. You  
**John Hagey:** Ooh, interesting. So,  
**GM or Aggie:** don't  
**John Hagey:** it's always a It's Is it always 2d12? But if you get two of the same, it's That's interesting.  
**Loami or Britt:** Even two words.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah,  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah, even two warm.  
**John Hagey:** What's the likelihood of  
**GM or Aggie:** it's uh it's pretty hard.  
**Loami or Britt:** Weird.  
**John Hagey:** that?  
**GM or Aggie:** There's like um 144 combinations, right?  
**John Hagey:** Wow.  
**GM or Aggie:** So  
**John Hagey:** So, it's a lot harder to get a crit in this than it is in like your regular D and D,  
**GM or Aggie:** yeah,  
**John Hagey:** huh?  
**GM or Aggie:** uh the the the bell curve is is kind of similar,  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** but the outliers are more impactful.  
**John Hagey:** I see.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um and but if we ever do roll double twelves or double ones, I don't care what the rules say. So keep that in mind.  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
**John Hagey:** Oh no. So they're going to be a super critical fail.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um yeah, so like a nine of fear.  
   
 

### 00:43:34

   
**GM or Aggie:** I think um Ignatius is he's kind of a lot going on here  
**Loami or Britt:** It's  
**GM or Aggie:** and  
**John Hagey:** I think Ignatius like had this facade of like confidence walking in and  
**GM or Aggie:** um  
**John Hagey:** then getting through this it just melts away. Like what the f\*\*\*?  
**GM or Aggie:** uh I think coming right after you is a uh a tall like nicely dressed kind of like a Bridgetgertonesque vibe but a little bit more meat. on him. Um, he's uh pretty like quintessentially uh like Chad Blonde but from, you know, Oxford.  
**John Hagey:** Nice.  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh, and he he's like,  
**Loami or Britt:** Awesome.  
**GM or Aggie:** "Don't worry, Chad. It's so like welcome to the show, mate." And oh, wait, are you you not are you from Sorry, I don't mean to be rude. I just It's kind of cool to meet someone from uh what is your island called? Um,  
**John Hagey:** The Ashland Islands, the Ember Isles.  
**GM or Aggie:** ah, yes, that's what you called him.  
**John Hagey:** Those  
**GM or Aggie:** We weren't We weren't ever sure.  
   
 

### 00:44:41

   
**GM or Aggie:** I don't know that I knew. I It's been um uh Sorry, what? Lance. Oh,  
**John Hagey:** What gave it away?  
**GM or Aggie:** I mean,  
**John Hagey:** Was it Was it the Soot or the literal flames?  
**GM or Aggie:** um, you are on fire,  
**Loami or Britt:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** lad. Yes,  
**John Hagey:** Yes.  
**GM or Aggie:** it's back,  
**John Hagey:** Yes. That's how that  
**GM or Aggie:** right? Yeah.  
**Loami or Britt:** Wow.  
**John Hagey:** works.  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh I think he's like he's he's just trying not to be entirely  
**Loami or Britt:** Second question.  
**GM or Aggie:** disrespectful, but like it's um well,  
**Loami or Britt:** Man's got a  
**John Hagey:** No, man. It's okay. I don't I get  
**GM or Aggie:** it's hard to it's hard to wipe off.  
**John Hagey:** it.  
**GM or Aggie:** I mean, it's something that never leaves you. I mean,  
**John Hagey:** You'll get used to it. It's  
**GM or Aggie:** I I all respect I hope I hope not,  
**John Hagey:** fine.  
**GM or Aggie:** actually. um this uh I'll see you.  
**John Hagey:** Yeah. Cool.  
   
 

### 00:45:30

   
**John Hagey:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** And he walks like 10 feet and he turns around.  
**John Hagey:** Nice talking to  
**GM or Aggie:** He says,  
**John Hagey:** you.  
**GM or Aggie:** "Oh, thou uh th can I will your hand burn me?"  
**John Hagey:** I don't think so. I shake his  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh it doesn't burn him.  
**John Hagey:** hand.  
**Loami or Britt:** Oh,  
**GM or Aggie:** And he's like, "All right, jolly good." patching like what the f\*\*\* he storms off and he's got like his rag off. He's spitting and like uh trying to get all the all the the It's just Yeah, it's  
**John Hagey:** I think Ignatius finds this really funny because like that's not a normal thing for him to always be covered in  
**GM or Aggie:** just  
**John Hagey:** stone. It's just because of how far he's traveled and where he's had to travel. Like it's not a normal thing, but he just plays into it every now and  
**GM or Aggie:** nice. Nice.  
**John Hagey:** then.  
**Loami or Britt:** Huh?  
**GM or Aggie:** Um  
**John Hagey:** Well, not barbarians. Like, we clean ourselves. I just they've been traveling for a long  
   
 

### 00:46:22

   
**GM or Aggie:** yeah.  
**John Hagey:** time.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Um  
**John Hagey:** What is What is it from Doctor Strange?  
**GM or Aggie:** and  
**John Hagey:** And that's the Wi-Fi password. We're not  
**GM or Aggie:** yeah, exactly.  
**John Hagey:** savages.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um and then Lomi. Yeah, like I I think that you you might have even seen some of the inside of the of Vimua because I think you you came across as part of the the maintenance crew on it. Um so I don't it wouldn't be a huge surprise to you.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** You might you probably even you know you worked here normally. Um but I think you're like I don't know maybe a little bit proud or impressed of of how far it's come because it is getting pretty close to holding students and it was it was just a boat and a ship like half a  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** year ago.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah. I think this would be like he's he probably goes kind of under the surface more or less if by this point like early on setting up the cranes and stuff he's probably a part of but then he kind of goes underneath and keeps the keeps the boilers running by the time that the buildings are kind of set in place.  
   
 

### 00:47:32

   
**Loami or Britt:** So, I think he he's coming out and and just looking around and going,  
**GM or Aggie:** go.  
**Loami or Britt:** "Yeah, this will do. This is this they do good work." They do. You know what? What can we say? They, you know, all all power to them. You know, it's a little more cushy than the Boiler Room. I'll say it. Doesn't take as much doesn't take as much grit, but, you know, they do good work.  
**GM or Aggie:** I love it. Um I think and I think uh Lomi might even um he runs into he recognizes someone because you've you've kind of been around the the campus now, but there is um someone else who surprised you who's coming out of the exams around the same time. Um and all you know him by is Sarge. And you know him because the workers would have these campfires set up that you that would be like the social hour. You just go and um have a drink by the fire, maybe grill some stuff, use that the funny, you know, it's always like do we cook with the obsidian or do we cook with the camp grill like and there's a whole debate about which one give us better quality meat and all that.  
   
 

### 00:48:37

   
**GM or Aggie:** And um he I think Sarge catches your eyes like loaves,  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** loaves, we made it. Can you believe it?  
**Loami or Britt:** Hey, Sarge, you made it in. Hey,  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah,  
**Loami or Britt:** I I was feeling pretty good about myself until I saw you come in,  
**GM or Aggie:** you little cut down here.  
**Loami or Britt:** huh?  
**GM or Aggie:** Hey.  
**Loami or Britt:** They let anyone in here,  
**GM or Aggie:** Hey.  
**Loami or Britt:** huh?  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Yeah. I'll be honest. Barely cut it. Barely cut it.  
**Loami or Britt:** Hey,  
**GM or Aggie:** I I  
**Loami or Britt:** I didn't I don't even know what I was talking about.  
**GM or Aggie:** think  
**Loami or Britt:** They the green flag popped up and I said, "All right, let's you know, let's give this a go." Hey,  
**GM or Aggie:** I couldn't even read two of them. What were they saying? Those words.  
**Loami or Britt:** you always guess C, right? That's what they say.  
**GM or Aggie:** Is that third one?  
**Loami or Britt:** Third one.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Loami or Britt:** Third symbol.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:49:18

   
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. I just, you know, looked at the typewriter. So, that seems about right. Uh, and s\*\*\*, dude. Uh, it's kind of a lot going on. Um, I don't I don't know if I'm actually cut out for this.  
**Loami or Britt:** You know, this is it's pretty overwhelming. I'll be honest. It's pretty overwhelming. Uh we'll uh you know, I think we just give it our best shot. See what happens. You know, we you know, we always got something to go back to if it doesn't work out.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah, you're right. You're right. I mean, I just I got to remember why I'm here, you know? Got to remember why I'm here. I'm doing this doing this for the labs.  
**Loami or Britt:** That's right. Got to represent  
**GM or Aggie:** And uh I I don't I think maybe over the campfires you've um is what type of social person is Lomi? Is he like a lock it all in super going to remember everything about you?  
   
 

### 00:50:15

   
**GM or Aggie:** your family, your wife, your kid, your dog that time that you know he went to band camp or is he not as like connected with  
**Loami or Britt:** I think I think he's the memories that he has are ones that  
**GM or Aggie:** People  
**Loami or Britt:** you've shared. Like he's he's not going to remember kind of about your past, but he's going to remember that one time you ordered a drink that was way too strong and it knocked you on your ass or whatever. Like that that sort of shared  
**GM or Aggie:** Gotcha.  
**Loami or Britt:** experience.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Yeah. In that case, then all all that Lomi really kind of remembers about Sher's background is that one of the nights of the campfire, he was kind of crying and and he got real and then he he decided he was going to he was going to do the application and and then y'all got hammered drunk and then woke up the next morning on the floor  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** like uh he's got some sort of and and and maybe there's a couple of  
   
 

### 00:51:05

   
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** pickling memories in there for Lomi that he has something like he he had something to do with adventuring.  
**Loami or Britt:** Uhuh.  
**GM or Aggie:** He wasn't a grease monkey. He he came from the other side of the academy.  
**Loami or Britt:** Gotcha. Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um and more like Yeah.  
**Loami or Britt:** He was kind of like a manager of the side. Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** Like he he he talked enough about his travels that even Lily picked up that he he was like he wasn't he was the grunts who had been, you know, he kept he kept the things running but not got no glory for it.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** that kind of guy versus Lomi is the at home version in my mind of kind of what  
**Loami or Britt:** Perfect. Yeah. Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** some um okay so at some  
**Loami or Britt:** Totally.  
**GM or Aggie:** point um the flow takes all of you across into uh this this massive auditorium and it's it's pretty big like it sits 10,000 um which is only like there's about 70,000 people who are coming through right now and so they just been running like a uh initiation presentation like every 3 hours so that they'll get through and you can you can attend one throughout the day and it's it's super like there's a bunch of um students because the Vimua like the students are vastly over over outnumbered by the candidates right now.  
   
 

### 00:52:35

   
**GM or Aggie:** there's only like a two or 4 thousand students up to this point right now. Um, and so every now and then you see them and they're basically all hands on deck acting as like guides pointing the candidates towards the great hall. Um, and so unless unless y'all would deviate, that's where that's where you're being directed. Would would all of you head that way?  
**Loami or Britt:** So the like mechanical clarification, the students are the ones who like traveled on the ship and like got here and were helping get stuff prepped and and all that.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Yeah. Lummy would know the students and the students are Yeah. Like if you they're the ones hunting for that elusive title of explorer not which is only given out to like top 10% of the entry level.  
**Loami or Britt:** Gotcha.  
**GM or Aggie:** So there's only a thousand of these titles up for grab for the 100,000 people that came in this year. Those candidates are fighting for the top hundred slots for their  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** thousand.  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
   
 

### 00:53:35

   
**Loami or Britt:** Perfect.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um but obviously they've gone through through some of the curriculum and things like that already. Uh okay. Any good good any other questions? All right.  
**Holly Strebel:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** So the the flow brings you into that huge auditorium and um the mo the majority of of people like there's um it's mostly all from harmony. There's like I think there's a couple of other ash bloods that might be in your class that we can come back to, Ignatius, but there's no other Mizi. We talked about that. There's no other clans like in existence. So, everybody else is from Harmony. Uh, which makes you all quite a bit minority and and every time someone kind of recognizes that you're um from a different place, then it's like a minor celebrity status is how you're usually reacted to. Um, so you you make it in and the uh after a few minutes a small like um if you've seen Arcane Professor Heimerdinger is the image that you need to have in your mind, but a female version of of him, which is basically like a small uh teddy bear guy who or girl who is just bouncing with this like vibrant kinetic energy and um jumps her way onto the stage.  
   
 

### 00:55:00

   
**GM or Aggie:** and says, "Hello students. Hello candidates.  
**John Hagey:** So,  
**GM or Aggie:** Hello potential adventurers. I'm just so excited for this next class. It's going to be amazing. You're going to discover so much. You're going to go wherever your hearts take you. Just we we we us here. All of us are the inheritors of great discovery. For 80 years,  
**Loami or Britt:** I  
**GM or Aggie:** 80 years our maps have been static. We've missed the thrill of adventure. No one's wanted to do it. I've been lonely. Honestly, no one wanted to come. Not to say that my thousand weren't really great, but it's a lot better to have more. More is always better. But we've got ash bloods whose mastery of heat brings new fire to our core. We've got the maze whose well, we don't really know what they do, and that's amazing. We don't know. It's been so long since we could say that about anything. We mapped everything.  
   
 

### 00:55:51

   
**Loami or Britt:** think I I think during this part of the speech I whispered to Aggie, "I don't trust this f\*\*\*\*\*\* guy.  
**John Hagey:** Love  
**GM or Aggie:** Does that actually start like coughing?  
**John Hagey:** it.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Um I think she's going to respond. Like she she really does have a lot to say, doesn't she?  
**Loami or Britt:** I'm sorry, Warren.  
**GM or Aggie:** She does. She she has she has a lot of energy. I think she does this all day. This is my third time doing this speech. And you know what? I can't get enough of it. It just makes me so so happy to be up here and think of all your young and old and middle minds coming and and helping us discover this vast forgotten new who knows world. But the map it's not empty. It's just it's just waiting. It's just it's just it's just missing variables. It's missing equations. There's so much to learn and you're going to be the ones to find it.  
   
 

### 00:56:58

   
**GM or Aggie:** You're gonna find the threads. You're gonna find what's been lost. You're going to find what's been found. And you're going to get the glory that awaits us all. Because here at Bamboo, it's just the start.  
**Holly Strebel:** It's  
**GM or Aggie:** And where we go, who knows? So, welcome. Welcome. As you exit the great hall behind me, the loom will assign you your first home here at Venua. And I don't know, we will see how many of you make it through. I hope it's all of you, but it can't be. Unfortunately, we do have to lose another 20,000 of you by the end of the week. So, study hard, listen to your professors, and enjoy your time here. Welcome again. And then she like bounces her way uh back across the stage. And that's basically it for like end dog is just this little vibr. Oh, and she pops my couch like, "Oh, um yeah, I'm Dean. I'm Dean. My name's the Dean Salty.  
   
 

### 00:57:54

   
**GM or Aggie:** If you need me, uh you can try to find me. It's not that I'm hiding. I just I'm kind of busy." And I I really shouldn't be doing this part. And this is from my first speech and I thought I had on the second one and and then like an attendant comes out and she like man um for the Mizi you recognize real who leans out pulls her back behind the uh the curtain and clearly seems to have like a very familiar relationship with the dean. Um, and she then just waves good luck. Uh, and goes in. But and real seems to be uh she's like very well dressed in this like really cool um like romper, blue romper, and she's got like a little turban in her hair and she just seems to be much healthier than when you last saw her. Um, but yeah, and she she locks arms with uh with Dina Soldi who is just like bouncing up and down as she it goes in to the the back room. Uh, and yeah,  
   
 

### 00:59:00

   
**Loami or Britt:** Does real does real know me and Aggie or not or not so much?  
**GM or Aggie:** and then she Yeah,  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** she would.  
**Loami or Britt:** Like personally she would know us.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah, she would know your names.  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
**Holly Strebel:** Awesome.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, and she probably even knows that you're enrolled because as soon as you went through the entry exam,  
**Loami or Britt:** All  
**GM or Aggie:** like you would have been flagged for uh anomalous thoughts,  
**Loami or Britt:** right.  
**GM or Aggie:** but maybe not. Who knows? Um, cool. So, at that next as you kind of go through the um the exit hall, there's there's a couple of of students that are like sort of lingering, but you can tell they're they're kind of trying to force everyone out to make room for the next version of Dina's welcome speech. Um, and on the far side you can see like kind of like a a ride at uh like Universal or something where it has all those like 50 doors that open at one time so that you can kind of exit along your your aisles.  
   
 

### 01:00:02

   
**GM or Aggie:** That thing happens out the back of the amphitheater. Um, and you see as people are walking by, they're pausing for a second and a little receipt of paper prints out and then they rip it off and then they exit and it prints off and ripped and they exit. Um, so, uh, anyone would anyone, this is kind of like we're almost past the, uh, intro stuff here. Um, but assuming would anyone like try to hang out and and talk to other students or is it still like got to go because they're forcing me to  
**John Hagey:** Wait,  
**GM or Aggie:** go?  
**Holly Strebel:** Uh, I think Iggy, first of all, during the acceptance speech, he like nudges the person next to him. He's like, "So, this is a school." I This is a  
**John Hagey:** what is what is it you say?  
**Holly Strebel:** school. I got into a school.  
**John Hagey:** Yeah. Yeah, bro.  
**Holly Strebel:** We're all here for a school.  
**John Hagey:** Where did you think you Where did you think you were?  
**Holly Strebel:** I I don't I I just followed the path.  
   
 

### 01:01:07

   
**John Hagey:** How did you get here accidentally? I've literally hiked like hundreds, if not thousands of miles to get here.  
**Holly Strebel:** Well, I had quite the adventure,  
**John Hagey:** Did you just Did you apply?  
**Holly Strebel:** too, but I'm not going to tell you about it. I just So, it's a school.

**John Hagey:** like here you want  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah, I do.

**Holly Strebel:** How deep down does that boat  
**Loami or Britt:** Uh yeah,

**Loami or Britt:** the boat sits on the surface and the other one goes in the air and they kind of come back and they do like a you know a ritual and get them all connected and and all that. They don't they don't go under the water. They they stay on top unless something's seriously wrong.  
   
 

### 01:03:03

   
**Holly Strebel:** You sure?  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah, they're going to stay on top of the water.  
**Holly Strebel:** Okay, I'm going go get a little closer look.  
**GM or Aggie:** He's  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah, take it all in. It's a lot to take  
**Holly Strebel:** And he just walks away.

You need something? You let Lucky know? I'll get it for you." That guy's red hot hair. Look at it.

Hot off the rock. Authentic. Probably an ash blood. That's worth something. I'm lucky. And he kind of goes up to Iggy and he's like, "You? I'm lucky.

**Holly Strebel:** trombone instrument that just like is absolutely useless.  
   
 

### 01:07:47

   
**GM or Aggie:** Nice. Does he do you  
**Holly Strebel:** It's like it it like it's like an accordion. It like pulls out,  
**GM or Aggie:** like  
**Holly Strebel:** unfolds, and it makes like the most god-awful sound.  
**Loami or Britt:** So, so Iggy is from Dr. Seuss. This is what he is the Lorax.

**GM or Aggie:** anyway.  
**Loami or Britt:** Lucky with the insoles, bro.  
**Holly Strebel:** You're welcome.  
**GM or Aggie:** You're welcome. Hey, make sure that um when that guy comes in here, he probably don't want to see you with that. Better be Lucky. And then Lucky bolts his way down as he sees the the gu like the guards are coming in to shoe the last the crowd and one of them is is absent his turban and uh Iggy is like standing on the chair with this thing.  
**Holly Strebel:** He's already blowing his nose into it.

**GM or Aggie:** Can I just like  
**Holly Strebel:** away.  
**GM or Aggie:** flubixed? Like, did this kid just take my hat to use it as a tissue and then give it back to me?  
**John Hagey:** Ignatius is just laughing his ass off and he's going to grab Lo and be like, "Let's  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah, let's get out of here. I don't,  
**John Hagey:** go.  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh,  
**Loami or Britt:** you know, I I'm definitely not feeling quite as lucky as that guy. So, let's let's get  
**GM or Aggie:** it's amazing.  
**Loami or Britt:** lost.  
**GM or Aggie:** So, Iggy, Ignatius, and Lomi make your way towards the end of the uh little like aisle corridor, and you pass by the machine, and it prints out a uh a line item, like a little uh punch card for each of you.  
   
 

### 01:10:20

   
**GM or Aggie:** And the Iggy it says like um Iggy and then it says block 12 printed out and then drops and then um Ignatius block 12 printed out. Lomi block 99 printed out. Uh and then Britain Aggie you would have gotten block four printed out.  
**Loami or Britt:** Nice.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um and as you come up behind uh so now you're back like behind the buildings is where the um the you there's like um uh the campus loops around in a big horseshoe courtyard outside of the center courtyard. So the dorms are all of these buildings that have the scaffolding going up. So, if you were to look top down, it would have the airship and the the um cruise ship, I guess, there there' be there's an inlet that goes out to the sea from in front of the cruise ship, like a big horseshoe. Um, and then there is another big horseshoe where all of the courtyard and the buildings are. So, um, I can probably draw that if you need to. I didn't do it top down, but not super important.  
   
 

### 01:11:30

   
**GM or Aggie:** Point is, uh, there's plenty of room to ex like spread out on this side of the campus. A lot more flat ground, a lot less buildings. Um, but there is a map there that has, uh, blocks one through 99 in that horseshoe pattern in a number like starting from one going all the way to 99 at the end. Uh, and there is a um a student with a little like bullhorn thing. just um go to your rooms for tonight and tomorrow your first class Jened education exploration 8 a.m. sleep tight tomorrow first class JED education exploration 8 a.m. sleep titan is just saying that over and over and over by the map.  
**Loami or Britt:** Sorry.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, and every now and then he stops, takes some questions, and then gets his horn back out and starts yelling again as people are exiting the main hall. Um, Brit and Aggie, I feel like you all kind of got out of the main room pretty quick. Um, where to now? Do you go straight to the dorms to like settle in or do you go explore for a little bit?  
   
 

### 01:12:45

   
**GM or Aggie:** It's it's still like fairly earlyish in the afternoon. Um but you can see that there is some gaggles like students that are um congregating in the courtyard areas and then there is also a lot of people going to their dorms.  
**Loami or Britt:** I  
**GM or Aggie:** I don't know what we're doing. My first thought is how familiar are we with the concept of time like as in o'clock time  
**Loami or Britt:** definitely  
**GM or Aggie:** versus just like sunset? Sure. excited. I think that yeah, like you you would have hours of the day. Um and uh I don't know if there needs to be anything complicated to measure it as easy. Uh but you would know. Yeah, you would you would have at least I was wondering if we knew clock times. Yeah, I think so. um like the the maze is still they still live in like homes for the most part and have like a mostly functional civilization. just sort of sort of beat up and sort of run down compared to the the luster of harmony, but you could  
   
 

### 01:13:57

   
**Loami or Britt:** I think I'm I think I'm my instinct is definitely not to go to the dorm.  
**GM or Aggie:** check.  
**Loami or Britt:** I think I'm like we need to look around.  
**GM or Aggie:** I think now that people are like spreading out a little bit more, Aggie is a little less overwhelmed and now the curiosity is growing. It's like, okay, now I can like breathe and like actually like look around and see things. So now she wants to see more. I think she at least wants to do like a lap around all the buildings before going back to their building. Okay. At the very least. Yeah. Then she can at least pretend like they're like, you know, looking for the right building. Cool. So in that case, like looking at the map and looking around and as you walk, you would see a couple of main buildings. There's the great hall that you just came out of. Um the auditorium seemed to be one of a couple. Uh it's pretty pretty massive building.  
   
 

### 01:14:50

   
**GM or Aggie:** And um and then there is a large like basically amphitheater probably the only place that can host all the students at one in one time. And it looks more temporary. It's like not a permanent thing, but that's just built into the hill off to the side of the campus. Um you can see that marked on the map. You can also see there are um there's a a series of buildings that uh are basically like Greek Row. They seem to be as you're walking by them like there is a definitely like a posh club feel to them and all of the people there are well-dressed and sophisticated looking and or they're having a a rockish party. Um, and so the the very it's very like universityish style, which is funny because there is like 80year-old grandmothers holding court on the, you know, the beer pong table and then there are also like kids who are like there's no easy way to know how old anyone is because there's so many species intermixing in harmony that they've just kind of come to accept that like whatever happens will happen and it's probably Okay.  
   
 

### 01:16:04

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um, and we'll do the best we can to be common sense where where it like matters. Um, but so there's like yeah, there's a little like Greek row area. There is a small office that is actually called clan assistance and integration. Um, and has a little tagline like Maze or Ashblood. Have questions? Come here. Um, it's nine o'clock. Our lights just switched. Um there is a um there's a a huge library off to one of the sides. Um and then there are there's obviously the two big ships. There's the the deep hole and the uh the sky ship. Um and then there's a large cliff that kind of makes up one of the other borders of the the like campus area. Um, your dorm, your dorm specifically, uh, block four is, um, actually like a modular unit that's currently built into the terrace cliff and has, um, it's kind of like it seems to be like the herbology class or the green room that's been expanded into a temporary dormatory until they get down to like approximately the student body that is going to continue for more than a week.  
   
 

### 01:17:27

   
**GM or Aggie:** And then there's, you know, like the other blocks are they kind of seem to be um using some  
**Holly Strebel:** Um,  
**GM or Aggie:** of the labs as dorms. They probably won't use do the lab until the initial genet is done. So all the specialized buildings uh don't have any of their equipment in it. They just have bodies in it right now. And you're in one of those. There's also like a geothermal plant looking thing that's got a bunch of like um steam coming out of it that people are actually seem to be bunking in. Uh and that's where Lomi would be headed. And then there is a uh a bunch of like more classic dorms where a lot of the student body is also going. That's where Iggy and Ignatius would be going. any of those catch your eye that you'd want to like try to go into?  
**Loami or Britt:** I think I want to go into the where Lomi is into the sort of steam the place that looks like it's it's industrial something like that where you know things are being built things are being there's energy there because I think that's a partial concern for us is that things are being things are moving and building and  
   
 

### 01:18:44

   
**GM or Aggie:** interesting. Interesting.  
**Loami or Britt:** continuing.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay, I dig that. Um,  
**Loami or Britt:** for me.  
**GM or Aggie:** so while while they did the long route, um, Ignatius, Lomi, would y'all have gone directly to your assigned rooms or would you have detourred elsewhere?  
**John Hagey:** Uh I think Ignatius is well once Ignatius immediately like as soon as Ignatius finds out that uh Iggy it's it's Ignatius and Iggy  
**Loami or Britt:** Mhm.  
**John Hagey:** right as soon as he finds out that like oh this is the little guy that like I had a short conversation  
**Loami or Britt:** And Aggie  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** with. He's like oh I guess I guess we're going to be bunk mates. Like should should we make it like go to our room? He's literally just going to like follow Iggy and just be like, "Are we like I guess we're going to go to our room now, right?" And he's just going to see what Iggy does. Like he's expecting to walk straight to his room, but like if Iggy were to turn a corner or something, he would probably just be like, "Yeah, f\*\*\* it. I'm down." And would probably just follow  
   
 

### 01:19:53

   
**John Hagey:** Iggy.  
**Holly Strebel:** I'm not going to the room.  
**John Hagey:** Oh, where where are you going?  
**Holly Strebel:** I don't know.  
**John Hagey:** You're just not going to go to the dorm room.  
**Holly Strebel:** No, there's so much to see.  
**John Hagey:** Yeah, we have but we have class  
**Holly Strebel:** Look, class.  
**John Hagey:** tomorrow.  
**Holly Strebel:** I need to find out things. I'm go I'm just gonna walk around. You don't have to come.  
**John Hagey:** Yeah, but now I'm curious.  
**Holly Strebel:** Well, then come on.  
**GM or Aggie:** That's what  
**John Hagey:** Ignatius is appalled that he was like for a second about to be a rule follower and then this little like thing was like no we're just walk around like who am I all rightious is just gonna follow  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Where  
**John Hagey:** the whims of Iggy for a little bit Ignatius is less curious about everything going on around him and more curious on like what is this little like thing gonna do because he's still not 100% sure what Iggy is.  
**GM or Aggie:** Fair enough.  
**John Hagey:** He he digs them,  
   
 

### 01:20:56

   
**GM or Aggie:** There have been there have been a lot of weird creatures  
**John Hagey:** but he's just not really sure what the deal is. He's like,  
**GM or Aggie:** you've seen, but but Iggy is is pretty odd. Uh, and clearly like asking he's just he's not acting like very many other people for sure. Most everyone else is kind of following the script right now. There's a couple of outliers, but yeah.  
**John Hagey:** If if if Iggy is curious about seeing everything else, Ignatius is curious about Iggy. So, he's like, "Now's the time to figure out more about the person I'm rooming with." So,  
**GM or Aggie:** I love it. Uh, where does Aggie's feet take him?  
**Holly Strebel:** He is he has like his journal back out. He pulls some contraption out of his little bag of tricks that's like a big magnifying glass that just like amplifies his already ginormous eyes that he has goggles on. Um, and he's like literally walking down every hallway looking at everything and like drawing the whole thing. But like when you look at it, it just looks like a schizophrenic is taking notes.  
   
 

### 01:22:08

   
**Holly Strebel:** Like there's no making sense of his notes, but like it makes sense to him. So he's just like go he's just following the path. He's not really going anywhere particular, but he's like just trying he's looking for all of the details and he's like noting  
**GM or Aggie:** Gotcha.  
**Holly Strebel:** things.  
**GM or Aggie:** What is his pace like? Is he is he is he thorough and he still hasn't even left the great hall or is he is he tearing up  
**Holly Strebel:** I think it's like it's very like he's all of a sudden he catches a wild hair and he's like,  
**GM or Aggie:** ground?  
**Holly Strebel:** "Oh, this is good. This is good. This is good." Oh. And then he'll stop and then he's like really thoroughly inspecting like something very small. Oh, this is nothing. Oh, this is good. He just is like completely muttering to himself. He'll like ha he'll turn to Ignatius and have him hold random things and pull out new tools from his bag that he uses to inspect things and then he puts it all back.  
   
 

### 01:23:02

   
**Holly Strebel:** Like it's just chaos that I don't think Ignatius could make any sense of. But it's it's just Iggy like exploring in detail his  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. So,  
**Holly Strebel:** surroundings.  
**GM or Aggie:** the first thing as he comes out of the the main room, there's kind of a long hallway that goes to the right that seems to be like towards other classrooms and auditoriums. There is the exit to the courtyard that most other people are going to.  
**Holly Strebel:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** And then there is kind of like fighting through the crowd to get to the hallway on the other side of the building that's s the symmetrical version of the one that's just to your right. So, you kind of exited auditorium, you know, on the right side of the building and you you could go to the right wing. You could go across the whole auditorium to the left wing or out into the courtyard where everyone else is sort of headed.  
**Holly Strebel:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, and there's the guy with the bullhorn just shouting stuff outside. Um, there's also like I mean probably for Iggy it's sort of novel.  
   
 

### 01:24:01

   
**GM or Aggie:** There's these you know there's lights on the wall. There's uh like locks on the doors that seem to open and close on their own. There's um like vehicles in the courtyard that seem to be like transporting things. There's cranes in the air dropping large loads of material and people all over the campus. Um, which like the way it sounds to me is he most he might have gotten outside and then  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** just  
**Holly Strebel:** I think he's outside and I think he's like if there's a crane, he's trying to climb it. Like he's trying to see like he wants to get the top vantage point to like assess his  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Uh, so Britt and Aggie,  
**Holly Strebel:** surroundings.  
**GM or Aggie:** as y'all are headed toward, you've done your lap around the campus, um, you start making your way towards like the industrial side where the steam is going up and, um, you see a a man on fire looking up at a little creature who's like halfway up a crane, who's just like hanging by his feet, um, dropping stuff down and the guy you can just hear like muffled shouts from the the man on fire on the ground and I think that you would have you would know what an emberkin is like that might have been but that's also like not really they're the ones that you would have the most um familiarity with because they're like very geographically close to the Mizi clan but there's also like a little bit of lore and history about the  
   
 

### 01:25:47

   
**GM or Aggie:** Ash Bloods that um makes you just generally distrust fire. Uh so that's you'll see that as you're going towards what is kind of like a currently repurposed dorms. Um and then you also see like there is um a small group of students who is started to like dig out a little uh hole in the ground and they're starting to throw like spare wood and things inside of it.  
**Loami or Britt:** I think it's definitely like a looking up and being like a huh what's going on? And then I think I say to Aggie, I think I'm like that looks promising. Come on. And I head toward Iggy and Ignatius.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Um, okay. Uh, and so Ignatius and Iggy are I mean I I literally like I don't know that Iggy is taking apart the crane as he's going up it. But I also don't like the um anything not bolted down isn't going down to Ignatius where he's holding your pack or something. He's like, "Hey, take take this one now." Um, but at some point maybe you get high enough that you can like you might accidentally look down or look around.  
   
 

### 01:27:08

   
**GM or Aggie:** And you've been above the ground before,  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** but you've never been above the ground with sky. And I'm I'm curious like is Iggy more scared of looking up or looking  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** down?  
**Holly Strebel:** I think I think he'll at some point you can touch it, right? Like I'm going to be able to touch it.  
**John Hagey:** I I think you are touching  
**Holly Strebel:** No,  
**John Hagey:** it  
**Holly Strebel:** but like I don't need to touch it.  
**John Hagey:** but uh What?  
**Holly Strebel:** Never mind.  
**John Hagey:** I mean, we can get on the flying ship. I mean, it'll get us more in the air, but you you are touching the air.  
**Holly Strebel:** But like I don't feel it.  
**John Hagey:** Ignatius just looks up and looks at Iggy and goes, "I didn't know you could feel it.  
**Loami or Britt:** I think Brit walks up and says,  
**Holly Strebel:** Well,  
**Loami or Britt:** "Come down, please.  
**Holly Strebel:** all I just need to see something.  
**John Hagey:** Why?  
**Loami or Britt:** Who is that?  
**Holly Strebel:** Why? Why are you guys following me?  
   
 

### 01:28:25

   
**Holly Strebel:** Nobody ever follows me. I just I just need to see something.  
**John Hagey:** I'm pretty sure you're my roommate.  
**Holly Strebel:** You  
**Loami or Britt:** Come,  
**GM or Aggie:** Is are they okay?  
**Holly Strebel:** are  
**GM or Aggie:** Are you  
**Loami or Britt:** come down.  
**GM or Aggie:** okay?  
**Loami or Britt:** Come down.  
**John Hagey:** I mean, I feel fine.  
**Holly Strebel:** Everything's fine, guys. I just need to diss  
**Loami or Britt:** are they're climbing up on like a scaffolding,  
**Holly Strebel:** you.  
**Loami or Britt:** right?  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah, one of the  
**Loami or Britt:** I think Brit reaches out and like starts to shake it and she says,  
**GM or Aggie:** cranes.  
**Loami or Britt:** "Come down now.  
**Holly Strebel:** Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay.  
**Holly Strebel:** Oh, let's I'll come down.  
**John Hagey:** I don't know.  
**Holly Strebel:** Hold on.  
**GM or Aggie:** No.  
**Holly Strebel:** Hold on. And then he p he's he's all he's trying to balance and he's got his notebook up and he's like in my mind Iggy is trying to just like plot out the whole like campus on a sheet. Like he wants to have a map of where he is is why he's getting up to the top vantage point.  
   
 

### 01:29:32

   
**GM or Aggie:** Okay.  
**Holly Strebel:** And he's trying to also see if he can see any more ships.  
**GM or Aggie:** All right.  
**Holly Strebel:** That's like his big like he's very intrigued by these two ships.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay.  
**Holly Strebel:** And so he's trying to like get better angles of it and also see if there's any other ships he can  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** see.  
**GM or Aggie:** And and maybe see if you can touch the  
**Holly Strebel:** And also he's I think there's a specifically there's a cloud and he just thinks that he's going to be  
**GM or Aggie:** top.  
**Holly Strebel:** just like grab it. He's never seen a cloud before.  
**GM or Aggie:** Great. Um, I love it. So, they uh, as y'all are standing there, so first Iggy from the top, um, you you got pretty high. I don't know that I see him getting taller than the buildings around because that's that's that's pretty up there.  
**Holly Strebel:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** And but I do think you probably got high enough to see over like the the press of some of the small buildings and high enough that more importantly you could see um on the horizon like there are steam towers sticking up and there are balloons in the distance and there's definitely a lot of things that are kind of like these two ships but in every other shape imaginable in every size.  
   
 

### 01:30:54

   
**GM or Aggie:** But you're just kind of like picking out the top of the spires, the top of the mast, the top of the like the ship themselves. But you can tell that they're um they're mostly gathered offshore partially because they can't they have nowhere to go until the tests are over. Um unless they have like a sea birth, in which case they're they're docked kind of where the where you came in.  
**Holly Strebel:** Got it. Got  
**GM or Aggie:** Um and  
**Holly Strebel:** it.  
**GM or Aggie:** then I think um uh as y'all are all there kind of gathered around this uh you see coming toward you a small um like um a small woman who is carrying like a little notebook and she's all put together and prim and proper like a very uh I very student looking. She's not she's currently not enrolled. She's not wearing like the academy colors that all the other students have been wearing, but she comes up and says, "Hi. Um, what are y'all doing? Are you do you know each other? Oh my god.  
   
 

### 01:32:02

   
**GM or Aggie:** Are you are you from the island? And are you are you um how would I know if you're are you are you? And are you Ashwa? Three of you all in one group. Oh, what a splendorous occasion.  
**Loami or Britt:** Take a photo. It'll last  
**GM or Aggie:** Oh,  
**Loami or Britt:** longer.  
**John Hagey:** Yeah. Is she if she's saying that like she's saying that Ignatius is just looking down like,  
**GM or Aggie:** person  
**John Hagey:** "Huh? Is she talking to us?"  
**GM or Aggie:** you plugged up there too.  
**John Hagey:** Like following Iggy.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah,  
**John Hagey:** I just didn't make it as far as Iggy at at all.  
**GM or Aggie:** that is funny. So then it's  
**John Hagey:** Like Iggy is way up there. Ignatius is maybe like 10 feet up.  
**GM or Aggie:** just  
**John Hagey:** Iggy's like 20 30 feet up. And you guys just like, damn.  
**GM or Aggie:** So then maybe before that as Brit's shaking the the tower, did you all start working your way back down?  
**John Hagey:** I guess I probably would, but it's Yeah, I I would work my way down, but more more to get down there and just be like, "What the f\*\*\* do you  
   
 

### 01:33:13

   
**Loami or Britt:** Well, now that this lady's here,  
**John Hagey:** want?  
**Loami or Britt:** I feel like I'm I think I'm like more concerned about this lady being here now. I've  
**John Hagey:** Complete 180\.  
**Loami or Britt:** stopped.  
**Holly Strebel:** Perfect.  
**John Hagey:** Like Ignatius is so confused. His attention span. It's gone so many different  
**Loami or Britt:** Can we Can we help you?  
**John Hagey:** places.  
**Holly Strebel:** Oops.  
**Loami or Britt:** What do you need?  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh, well, I was going to invite you over to Bonfire tonight. We're We're digging a hole on and we're Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** Oh, bonfire sound  
**GM or Aggie:** And I don't I I  
**Holly Strebel:** What's a bonfire  
**John Hagey:** legit.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah. How far away are  
**GM or Aggie:** um  
**Holly Strebel:** bar?  
**Loami or Britt:** you?  
**Holly Strebel:** He's still He hasn't left at all. He's still sketching. But like with the bonfire,  
**GM or Aggie:** like a a social get together at night usually uh by a fire. I don't know what the bond stands for. Of course.  
**Holly Strebel:** you're inviting me to a

**Holly Strebel:** immediately.  
**GM or Aggie:** here?  
**Holly Strebel:** puts the notebook and then like goes on the outside of the scaffolding and slides all the way  
**GM or Aggie:** We just see like him disappear and there's a plume of dust and then it comes back and he's just like standing there  
**Holly Strebel:** down.  
**GM or Aggie:** normal and there's a little like blast like pattern on the  
**John Hagey:** Just blast.  
**GM or Aggie:** ground. Oh my impressive.

**GM or Aggie:** She was just over there by Yeah,  
**Loami or Britt:** student.  
**GM or Aggie:** she was just over there by like the little bonfire area where the students were throwing in stuff and she kind of walked over to this little  
   
 

### 01:35:14

   
**Loami or Britt:** I think Brit puts her hand on her shoulder and says,  
**GM or Aggie:** gaggle.  
**Loami or Britt:** "I came off as aggressive. I apologize.  
**GM or Aggie:** It's okay. I sorry if I insulted you. Um, we're just like, that's really cool that you're from here. I don't I'm trying. I just want, you know, I'm an ally. Is that okay to say? Did I say that right? I think Agie's gonna fight up like don't mind my cousin. Hi, I'm Aggie. Hi. Uh, my name's Serra. Serra Vox. and she uh like has her little notebook tucked tucked in and she walks up it to give you a long hand uh handshake. She'll give her a handshake. How How are y'all settling in? Uh I I don't know. We just found these guys. She looks up again. Well, I guess he's down outside like Yeah. Uh, quite a crowd. I do think she's looking up to see if there's another.  
   
 

### 01:36:28

   
**GM or Aggie:** It's like, yeah, these  
**Holly Strebel:** Where's

**GM or Aggie:** um sorry, there's we don't really have like diplomacy books for this. So, I'm really kind of looking for for um what I can basically I'm just trying to understand if y'all have ever met each other before or this was your first time seeing each other here.  
**Loami or Britt:** All of  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh yeah,  
**Loami or Britt:** This  
**GM or Aggie:** I mean you're well you're from and she points to um your cousins and  
**John Hagey:** Um,  
**GM or Aggie:** and Missy because I can tell by your clothes and you're ash blood cuz you're on fire and um I haven't seen anybody else who's not from Harmony except and well and she looks at Lomi for a minute. She's like, "Are you also on fire? I can't tell because Lomi is over there too.  
   
 

### 01:37:36

   
**GM or Aggie:** You said he was going to the dorm and then  
**Loami or Britt:** He's going 99\. Uh, I'd say Lomi unintentionally gets to 99\. He like sees the Steam stacks and is like, "All right, here we go." And then he sees that it's building 99\. He's like, "All right, here we are."  
**GM or Aggie:** nice. Uh so yeah,  
**Loami or Britt:** But  
**GM or Aggie:** I mean maybe like if he was there because he's so he's still kind of grindy, right? He's still like he's I I picture him and grind as Ignatius.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah. Yeah. He's He's seeing a crowd. He'll he'll saddle  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Um so maybe Lo's walking in right as you can see he he sees Iggy.  
**Loami or Britt:** up.  
**GM or Aggie:** He sees Ignatius over there talking. He I think you might have seen Iggy drop out of the the crane like a little wrecking ball hammer.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um and then he sees the Mazi girls walking over and saying hello. So what would Logi do? Would he head inside the dorm?  
   
 

### 01:38:31

   
**GM or Aggie:** Would he go over to the little bonfire crew? Would he like say hi to the people he's already seen?  
**Loami or Britt:** So the these are other candidates or they're like existing  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah, it's all students. So,  
**Loami or Britt:** students.  
**GM or Aggie:** it's all it's all their candidates. Sorry.  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay. Okay, cool.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Loami or Britt:** And they're they're throwing stuff into like a like a bonfire like a pit or something.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Loami or Britt:** I Yeah, I think Lomi's Lomi's got to walk up to the the bonfire pit and kind of like looking in walking by the other candidates like So, you thinking you're going to lo use like an accelerant or something or we just going to go uh what do we got? Straight uh straight lumba in there? What's What's the plan?  
**GM or Aggie:** um uh there's a a a guy who's um who's kind of directing traffic a little bit. He says, "Oh, this is not the problem. We have it all here. A masked out look right here.  
   
 

### 01:39:25

   
**GM or Aggie:** Optimal flow across the woods. You get the light winds at the bottom, heavier winds at the top, and then well, we don't have a source of flame yet. That is a problem.  
**John Hagey:** Ignatius is just going to sit there and not say a f\*\*\*\*\*\*  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah,  
**John Hagey:** thing.  
**GM or Aggie:** This is just far enough apart that  
**Loami or Britt:** I think I think this is this is I think that's that's when Lomi  
**John Hagey:** Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good. Good.  
**GM or Aggie:** like  
**John Hagey:** Good. I was about to say  
**Loami or Britt:** goes Lomi like looks over his shoulder and is like I think we can solve that and and walks over to the starts walking over to that  
**GM or Aggie:** Nice. Nice. Um and I I like to maybe write comment and and say that that was when um when when Vox also came like oh are you going to talk to him? Can I come too? And then she like couldn't contain herself and ran ahead.  
   
 

### 01:40:13

   
**GM or Aggie:** Uh and so that's yeah that's how you met Serra.  
**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh and then now Lomi has kind of like joined the group as as y'all are talking. Um,  
**Loami or Britt:** All right.  
**GM or Aggie:** and okay, so 9:40. Uh, that's probably not a terrible stopping point if y'all want to call it there. Um,  
**John Hagey:** Seven  
**GM or Aggie:** since we we'll start with the group together for nighttime activity, first night on campus. Um,  
**John Hagey:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** and then we'll have class tomorrow and then y'all will take one more test and then the real stuff will start. So, the the couple of things that like I'd be interested to hear like as we play each session is like what are the what are the parts that are like intriguing you the most about the world. Um, and because I'm I'm just going to lay them out and like you as a group are going to choose which ones there are. But just know that it could be the exploration part like the world is is ready for it to be discovered.  
   
 

### 01:41:12

   
**GM or Aggie:** It could be figuring out what's going on at the academy and understanding like the political situation that's happening. Um, it could be just doing really good in class and want to prepare for that. So, um, as you think about like how your character might have started to understand the academy the first night, I'd be curious to see like which sounds the most um, interesting. So, yeah,  
**Loami or Britt:** Do you want our answers? No.  
**GM or Aggie:** I don't need them. If you if you know it, then yeah.  
**Loami or Britt:** I definitely think Brit's motivation is very much I think unintentionally she's very very good in class but her her main interest always has lied in what is what are the political ramifications of the academy and and what what is like hiding below the surface because something something is but but What  
**GM or Aggie:** Cool. Anybody else know or you still thinking about it?  
**Loami or Britt:** I think for Lomi it would be the transition from like candidate to student and then like forming the party to like how how that work how you get  
   
 

### 01:42:32

   
**GM or Aggie:** Thanks.  
**Loami or Britt:** selected in that and then what the what the first steps out of the academy, where you would go and what's this new this new found  
**GM or Aggie:** Cool.  
**Loami or Britt:** vigor for exploration.  
**GM or Aggie:** And it can also be like what your characters want and also just what sounded more interesting to you to like go and explore,  
**Loami or Britt:** Cool.  
**GM or Aggie:** you know, um the part of the campaign that sounds more fun. Uh but as Christine and I have been watching a little bit of the Skyward Hoe, which is a fun,  
**Loami or Britt:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** not quite the same vibe, but some of those same mechanics could come into effect if the exploring part is is really interesting or vice versa.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** up.  
**Holly Strebel:** I I think Iggy would be fine with whatever like ends up giving  
**GM or Aggie:** Cool.  
**Holly Strebel:** him answers. So, I don't know if he like I don't know if I can answer that yet. I mean, exploration sounds fun. I just don't know if like the deep underworkings of what all is going on is going to be tied with the academy or if it's something you find out outside of the academy because that would influence my answer like Yeah.  
   
 

### 01:43:56

   
**Loami or Britt:** Nice. Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** opinions up. I guess I can talk to you whenever. Okie dokie. Well, um

**GM or Aggie:** stuff. I don't know why your calendar isn't sinking or

**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** It's okay.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah.

**GM or Aggie:** That's true.  
**Loami or Britt:** That I cannot do that.  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah, that'd be

**Loami or Britt:** No, you said three through six.  
**GM or Aggie:** The sixth I'm doing the seventh  
**Loami or Britt:** You can't do  
**GM or Aggie:** is better than the six. It just depends on how long it takes for us to get from the plane to the hotel. Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** yeah, that's a lot.  
**Loami or Britt:** Yeah, that might be too I mean that's probably too  
**GM or Aggie:** I mean, we land at 7:40 p.m.

**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** So,  
**Holly Strebel:** And if everybody else can do the ninth and I can't,

**Loami or Britt:** Okay.  
**Holly Strebel:** Saturday?

**Holly Strebel:** Mhm. Yeah. No,

**Holly Strebel:** I can definitely do it anytime that  
**GM or Aggie:** she she flies from 12 to 7:30

**GM or Aggie:** on.  
**Holly Strebel:** there.  
**Loami or Britt:** Like I don't think I really have a full grasp on her.  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah. Honestly, if Luke we didn't end up chatting last night,  
**Loami or Britt:** So  
**Holly Strebel:** I think I still would have had no idea like about anything. So, that was really helpful to have like a little preach the night before.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah, a little little goes a long way.  
**Holly Strebel:** It was helpful to understanding.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um,  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** so definitely like I I'm pretty flexible, too. So, if anyone wants to just like do a little uh 40 minute what's the background or like precursor or anything like that, let me know.
