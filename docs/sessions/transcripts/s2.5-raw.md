Me: Hundred dollars a month to actually train with him. I'm definitely putting a lot of money between those two things. Yeah. So fun, so lifey. So lifey. I literally felt like I was in a locker room, too, bro. I just spent the last hour and a half of my life. I kind of need to get out of here. Yeah, I kind of am enjoying this. Because. It reminds me of. Sports. But also. Yeah. I'm not buying. Like. 60% of the shit you're trying to. Right now. 40. Percent. Was small. On advice if I lived listening to you for 15 minutes. And I get one tip, okay? If I got to listen to you an hour to get three tips, it's not worth it for me. Yes. He would go on good. Until he got to the diet part and. I was. Like. In no world. Am I losing 15 to 20 pounds in three weeks? Even if I don't eat anything. For that amount of time you lost me, my man. With just the workout. Yeah, you should have stayed where you were. Anyways. Okay. You're making me hungry, so I'm going to grab a quick something. Yeah, no, I guess it's kind of. I guess dinner time. And then we don't have to go too long. But there's a couple of things that I think. Makes sense for you to know. And I'm curious how well you'll be able to remember them. What's your go to drink of choice? Now. The christ. Don't make me have enough. They don't have enough flavor for me. I like them, but sometimes. Yeah, it's pretty good. It's got, like, all the lion's mane, magnesium, ashkawanda, whatever that word is. So been on the hunt for healthy drinks. Poppies I've had before. They're kind of like. Fruity sweet, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But have you tried any. Of the ollie. Moss. Yeah. I kind of feel like they're similar to Poppy. Or maybe it's just because the name is so close, and I always think they're the same, they're actually different. I feel like. Poppy. Pops are sweeter. Do you like them? Yeah. Well. I'm very particular about the poppies. The only one I really like is the watermelon one. And then. The ollipop. They have like a strawberries and cream or an. Orange freaking cream and those twit. But it's like a sweet treat. I feel like. Yeah. Those aren't all the cream soda ones. Without, like, cream soda typed. I don't think they're all. No, because they have their version. Of like a diet. Like a coat. Got you. I don't really like any of the soda. I don't know, soda to be given, like Dr. Pepper. I'll just drink the diet. I remember if I wanted Dr. Pepper. Yeah. I think only once I get of those are the green ones. I don't think poppies have cream options. Like the crease. Well, that's not true. They do have an orange cream. I think one. Too. Honestly. I tried to get it. Tell you. And it was a giant. So. I gave it to my coworker. But I. Do wonder. If. There's like. It has a lot of. Hand. Maybe. Sometimes 2. A day. Yeah. I just would much rather have something that's slightly carbonated. And. Flav. Or than just plain water. Yeah. I think right now I'd rather have a topo or just no flavor in just water. Like covering the water. Then have a look. But I don't want to go to the sort of side because I want it to taste like a seltzer, like a seltzer water. Yeah. I. Really crave. Anything other than. You should try. The. Lemon challenge. I like these. But I feel like they probably got too much fiction in them. Yeah. Should. Just try like flav. Ored vanilla. Water I do have. Elect. Rolyte. Vitamin placement. That I'll put in my water. But I only will do it. Today. After. Hard work. I don't use that. And I do. Fast. So quick. It's just like, oh, flavor. We do have a lot of those meos. And I got the little. Single use. Version of the SO Stream that I think you've seen. But it's just, like, one step more than what I wanted to go through. Yeah. I know. I should look. At what you have. Write down your pipe. That's like when I eat dinner, I just want something. It's at. Work. I feel like. Water. Fine. True. Good water. Most. Of the time. But when I have my dinner, I want or. Cooking a meal. I want something other. Than water to drink. Yeah, my initial purchase was. Like $50 or something. And I still have initial stuff. Doing what you got. I'll try to find it. I got it from speaking at a conference, and that was like. The gift that I paid. True. Have you thought at all about. I guess. While we're here to do the thing, have you thought of any more about Iggy's backstory? Now. Whether I think. We kind of ironed. Most of it out. I feel like. Yeah. Mostly in the context of people. I feel like we know his parents were on the council or something. That's how he found the tablet. He didn't fit in with normal crowd. And that all makes sense. Yeah. I mean, I guess it's probably mostly fleshed out. I shouldn't know if there was. Like a fun hook that you thought would be interesting to pull in. I. Think just. Purely. I. Had anticipated. Playing him as. A bit of a loner. But I think because he's so odd, people are gravitating towards him and following him in that I was not expecting. Which. Is adding more of, like, a comedic element. He's not used to people. Being interested in him. So, yeah, I think I went in with the intention of him kind of being, again, continuing to be the odd. Man. Out. And nobody. Really? Noticing him. All of a sudden. He's just such. An oddball, that's he. Scored off the charts. Too. Which is perfect. Because Sophie never retook it. But you're the only person who got gulped twice. Interesting. Do you think? That. That night like that. He was hanging out. With Ignatius and on the crane and doing that whole thing. Do you feel like that made him uncomfortable? Kind of to be followed around, or did he kind of secretly enjoy it? I think. He's secretly enjoyed it. Because as soon as somebody came up and asked, actually invited him to a party, That's why he slid down so fast, right? He was. Just like. It was like. The first time he's ever felt included in anything. I. Think the only thing that. Maybe. Was making him. I was so slightly annoyed. With the people telling. People stop doing what he was doing because he used to just being able to do whatever he wants. Because. Nobody's ever. Pay attention, grumpy. Part will come out. Is when people are interfering with what he wants to do. Because. Deal with somebody, but you have a barrier. Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay? I love that. So we don't have to do anything. Crazy that he wouldn't have done if you were there. But there are a couple of things that. I was imagining that for one reason or another, he caught a shiny penny moment and he wandered away from the group. So I don't want that to undercut him, actually feeling like he's fitting in and would have wanted to stay with the group. Yeah. That's also fine. I feel like at the end of the day, The reason. Why he's on the top of that crane? Because he's so intense figuring out what that machine is that he's convinced is the best thing. His home. Gotcha. For the first time. He needed to gather more information. And that is, like, his ultimate goal is trying. Even though his home. Never served him well. He wants to be like. I don't know if it's necessarily the unsung hero, but he still cares so much for his home and his people, even if they have never really cared for them. And so if there is anything that he could get more information about what is going on, he would leave the group for that, okay? Then I think that's kind of what I was thinking as well. That. The couple of things that might have caught Iggy's attention are one, some of the people around the campfire. So basically, what Iggy sees is that the group I like to play it that he noticed Ignatius looking back at him. He wasn't completely ignored or forgotten or anything like that. I feel like he was still starting to connect and fit in. But at some point, maybe there's this moment like Nisha's like, come on, come on, let's go, let's go, let's go. And then Iggy can see Ignatius is getting very excited about going to light this fire. At the same time, and everyone else is kind of like, meandering over, and no one is excluding him anymore, but there just happens to be a moment that they are actively talking to him. So he just kind of Irish goodbye. And the thing that I think would be slightly more interesting to Iggy than what's happening by the fire is just next to where the fire was, there is the power plant that you all were kind of originally by. And I think that the doors flip open for a second, and he just sees a bunch of cogs. And machines and parts worrying. And he sees someone walk out and the lights kind of dim. And also that the door was not locked. And so if he was intrigued by how is this city working? Then I feel like with the cogs and the things that he's always picking up and dealing with, that could be something that would hook him. There's also. The library. Which he just saw the map one time. He hasn't seen anything nearby. And then there is the city at large that he could also go wander to if he just wanted to go look at the docs or wanted to sneak into one of the fancy parties for some reason. Or. And then there's, like, the classrooms and dormitories. And then there is a small. It's pretty big city. There's a city area as well. And the immediate vicinity. It's like some campfires popping up, students walking out to parties off of the academy courtyard area, like somewhere back behind. I don't know if you have Foundry app. I can also screen share if you just want to use. Well, whatever you do for you, I can pull it up if I need to. You might roll wide, so it might be worth just pulling it up, actually. And I have some handouts in there, so that's probably best. You logged in. I got a new button, I think. Does this. Grab your screen and scroll you. What? Does that change where you are? Yeah, I was nice. Okay, cool. Yeah. You all are up here. Okay? And there's not cranes represented in the map, but there would be all over these buildings, cranes. And then there is this big, big courtyard. And then there is like that. That building is what seems to be the power plant. There's also this huge stadium. That is not the scale. Now that I'm looking at it. And it's a much, much bigger than this. And it's less of a state, even more of. A canyon that has bleachers around the top of it. Interesting, okay. And then there is a room that looks like an herbology classroom. And then there's the classic academia buildings, the students who are walking. So students are either going one to two places. They are either working their way over here. Or there's, like, sporadic bonfires that are popping up all around the courtyard. Got it. Okay. So what do you think he would have done? I. Feel like he would have. Gone like you said. The bonfire, and then I think, He would have social. Ized for a bit. And be like, Kind of. Gotten bored of it. Yeah. On to the next. Okay. Yeah, I think he would just have Irish goodbye at some point. Not said anything to anybody. There was ever a point that he could sneak out without them noticing. Okay, great. And then. In terms of. What? He gravitate towards. I mean. I would lean towards. The cog. S and the room. With all. The equipment. Cool. Sort of helping you and say that. So a couple of interesting maybe conversations that happen at the beginning that Iggy might have listened to as he was sort of socializing for a little bit. If I can remember. There was. You know, we spent a lot of time clarifying the ash blade population. And. That, like, there is probably a couple of hundred Ash Bloods, maybe more. So there's, you know, 70,000 people still left at the Academy. So 1 to 200 is really small, but at least not zero. And wouldn't be impossible in the courtyard, as you're seeing all the people going that you would see little gaggles. And then there was. A guy who is. I don't know if Iggy is very included in the social interactions. But there was a nerdy guy by the fire who was kind of in charge with setting up the fire, and he was poorly flirting with Sarah, who was the girl who came over to pull you all over towards the fire, kind of to begin with. And then there might have been. And that's probably, like, the two things that you would have heard and got bored of. Like there was a. There's a while that the. The Mazizi clan were explaining why death is a part of life. To people. So you'll maybe catch a little bit more of that in the. In the recap. But those are the types of things you would have heard before you wondered why. Okay, so now heading to the. Heading into the. The building. That says, like, the L power over the archway. It might be a little bit rhetorical, but Azeki just walking, or is he, like, having any sort of. Did he ever get in trouble, sneaking in somewhere? Yeah, that's a question to ask. I feel like he's very like. He's very short in stature. And he has that dark cloak on that was given to him when he arrived. So, like, I feel like it's dark outside. He's, like, pretty, just, like, naturally blend in the things. Yeah, I agree with that. But when he was back in the trench, did he ever get caught sneaking in? No. I feel like he's always gone unnoticed. And I don't know if that's because people just have ignored. I don't think he knows that that's just because people have ignored him or if he genuinely is. Naturally sneaky, but, like, yeah, I think he's. He's not somewhat of a cause of ruckus. And go notice typically. And probably also has something to do with his. His parents, like, mostly having access to anything anyway. And I don't really see the Trench being a, like, secretive clan. Yeah. I think he has, like, his little, like, treasure trove that he's been able to keep hidden, but. I think it's a combination of, like, yeah, he has had access to everywhere and also. Nobody ever really cared. But. I think just to, like, hit, like, the. The nature of, like, I envision, like, the nature of his people. They're so, like, one with the soil. They are part of the earth. Like, it's like he just kind of naturally. Yeah, I don't see. I don't pick from him as clumsy, okay? Yeah, we may have to change some of your class abilities. Because the version of wizard that you have right now is very healing other people and shoot bolts of lightning type of wizard, which I don't really see as the type of skills that Iggy has. And I like the idea of a skill that he has, but he doesn't realize he's using it that makes him even more unnoticed. Yeah. Yeah, I would be fun. Like, it's like he's always had this kind of, like, chip on his shoulder that everybody goes, Like, is ignoring him, but if he's accidentally, like, making himself blend in somehow, That would be actually funny that he, like. It out and especially think of. Like, which I don't know if it's at all. But. He's able to. Move the earth. Kind of like he's able to. Open. Up. There's a gap. But then all of a sudden, it's like he, like, can fit through it very easily. And then it's like, you know, like, things like that. Like Earth. Okay? Yeah. There's, like, two resources that we can play with, and we can we do this. I can do this Async and give you a couple of things to choose from, but one is, like, hope. What you get from rolling dice. Anytime you roll a dice and it lands with hope, you get a hope. And then there is stress. Which is, like something that you can. It's exactly what it sounds like. It's like stress. And the more stress you get, the less good you are at things. So I could see a version of Iggy's, like, sneaky skills. He gets stressed out, and then that activates passively. And then he gets more stressed out the more. And then he just crashes at some point. And then he wakes up in a random place, like, a day later. Yeah, I like that. And then the other side would be like, hey, he's intentionally doing things, which would be when he would be spending hope to, like, change the Earth. I really want to get in here. I really want to get in here. I'm really focused on this thing. And now that would be what he would use to, like, make that actually happen. I actually think I like that more from the Hyper Fixation. Yeah, you can have two. So I was thinking both of those things could be good. And then you. The player could choose when it activates and when it. When it doesn't, maybe. Or you can roll for it to determine if it triggers his reaction, like. His stress reaction. I'm just taking a note. Okay, so. Then it sounds so. How would he. How would he. Just describe how he would enter. The building. Like would he be? The door is currently closed. There is. I think through the glass he can see that there is. Most lights are off, but there's someone sitting behind a desk in there. I. Think because he's never been. Cold. He's not allowed to be anywhere. I think. He just opens the door and walks right in. I kind of agree with that, too. Okay? Yeah. So, iggy. Iggy is very short. And all he can see is the very, very top of red pointed hat. That's like walking back and forth, or it's moving back and forth behind the desk. And I think. Door. Hello? I. Think he would just. Be like. Let him. Just make a random noise. No. I think he just. Like. I think he. Would say. I can't remember. His. Oh, yeah. And then I imagine this, like, the goblin. When it sees Harry, it just, like, leans forward on the desk and looks down far enough, he sees the. This cute little, like, feminine bearded face of a gnome. Very, like, pointy chin, big green eyes. And the gnome. Says, oh, hello. Who are you? Nine a. M. A. Very good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for asking. Iggy. I am Tommy. Can I help you? Is there something you do or looking for? Oh, no. Just looking. That. Nice to meet you. I need to turn the walk away. Well, I guess it's nice to meet you, too. He's just muttering. I'm going to stop. The red. I'm going to keep walking. It was nice to meet holiday with ice and I'm just, like, muttering to itself. I don't think there is any reason or any. Am I supposed to leave you a book? Can I let. Dude, it's in here. Are you a student? Yeah, he was gonna be as. As a goes through. There's a dwarf that comes around the corner and she's just like. Basically almost a cousin. Of the gnome. But. A little bit burlier and wearing the mechanic overalls, whereas the gnome is wearing sort of like a. Like a scribe. Office clerk Type of attire Button up like collar. And door says, oh, here. Tommy. Did you let someone in? Are they. Lost. And then luke. I'm Lucy, and she just watches you, like, walk by. Right. It's lucina. Okay? And you just go like, are we allowed to let students back here? And they neither of them really follow you. And as you keep walking down, you go through this little lobby area, and it opens up into a large warehouse, and there is a bunch of machinery that is like you're kind of on, like, a catwalk. And the ground floor has a bunch of machinery. That is got glowing gems that are, like, plugged in to these panels. Which then seem to be connected to, like, the worrying cogs and the rotating machines, and it seems like there's a lot of things spinning. It's basically like turbines that are being powered by something and then. On the catwalk level, there is this little, like. Oh, it's quite big, actually. There's an office space that has that same glowing thing that's on the panel. There's a couple of them in a cabinet. And there is a big chalkboard with a bunch of scribbles on it. And then if you keep going as a catwalk, you'll eventually hit the staircase to go down to the bottom level. And then there's like. And then the cobalt goes all the way around, and there's a couple of offices spread out on that top level. But there's no one else back here. Well, there's one other person who is a tall human woman. You just see her head, like, bobbing in and out between the machines as she goes and does, like, whatever she's doing with wrenches and things down there. Okay? Where would you go? I. Think he pulled out of his little notepad? And he just starts drawing everything in details. I think he was just going down the catwalk. Like. Drawing from what he can see. And then. Like, ultimately, he's planning on going downstairs to, like, see it up. Okay. I feel like the. The things that he is drawing, as he looks up, he kind of feels like some of those things are drawn on the chalkboard, too. That is in the office to the left. Would he, like, try to copy any of that down or go into the office at all, or he. Does he care about the machines? I. Think if he's, like, drawing and then. All of a sudden he looks up. And he sees like him throwing from the chalkboard. He'll be like. He'll go in. And compare note. But he wants to do it on his own. So I think you go in just to see if there was, like, any details that they put that he didn't, but I think he is so. Trusting him like he knows he. Is, like, more detailed than most. So he, like, wouldn't take somebody else's drawing, per se, but I think he'd go in and look at it and compare. Okay, so there's. There's one drawing specifically that. Well, I guess there's two. And I'll just. I'll just. Share them with you. And you can. You can. You can be Iggy. Weird. Okay? Make you an owner of this one. So these two things are in the. Office. So the. The one that says Panda 5. Resonator battery that's on the left side of the chalkboard, and then the scribbles are on the right side of the chalkboard. And basically, as he's looking at the Panda 5, it looks like that. That blue box with all the arrows inside of it. Do you see that one? That looks like the little glowing gyms. They're like these. They're like car batteries, basically. About that size. And they have this internal matrix of, like, hexes and triangles. And that's glowing, soft glow, you can see those things are plugged into the panels downstairs. And there's like a. Like a large filing cabinet with several of them stuck in the filing cabinet. And there's a bunch of terms on here that Iggy would have no idea what they meant. But he can. Kind of. Maybe we'll see how good he is at, like, inferring some of their meaning. But he can read all of it. And so he would. He would have been able to draw. Like, I think that's probably the closest thing that he's drawn so far. Is this battery looking thing with a handle and this little, like, antenna that sticks out of the top corner. And this is some other things that he sees on the whiteboard. And then a quick overview. The other one, it has a bunch more words and a chart and then a bunch of red scratched out and, like, stars and question marks. Yeah. I feel. Like. Why don't you go ahead and roll me? A roll me, maybe. A knowledge. Yeah. To comprehend. That would be perfect. Yeah. Very high. 20 with hope. 22 with hope. Nice. Yeah. You also have, like, some skills that you can do if you wanted to. I'm just going to quickly reading through. Your. Skills and your character sheet. Yeah. So you can. You can turn mud into, like, a whip, and you can move underwater just fine. So, like, strange patterns would probably be something that's worth just using the same forever. It's like pick a number between 1 and 12. Seven. Okay? So whenever you roll a seven from now on, On either dice. You can gain a hope and clear a stress. So I just added that to your character sheet. Okay, so you are really able to get a good amount of learnings from this. So looking at before even looking at the drawing, there was a couple of themes that you felt like you were seeing on the batteries. Especially as you got closer to these glowing objects in the file encabment, you're able to observe them up close. One is which that. You felt like there was a lot more engineering in them than seemed necessary. It was just extremely well built. One, but two overbuild, as if it seemed to be like trying to contain a force that is much larger than the force that it has within it. I think maybe looking at some of the instruments, Iggy gets an idea of. There is some numbers that they are using to identify the amount of energy that these things are producing, and they seem to be the source of everything that's moving. It's like instead of throwing coal into the fire, Instead of using gasoline, it's these battery things. And some of the machines have, like, a dozen of them hooked in, and some of them only have one or two. So it seems like the. The batteries have a different amount of charge. Or, like the same amount of charge if you need more of them to do bigger tasks. And I think you know. I think that Iggy feels like he's pretty positive. He couldn't replicate any of the stuff he's seeing in front of him. But he feels like he's able to understand that there is. There's some sort of energy that it's meant to capture, and it's always capturing it, and it's just trying not to let it go above a threshold. So it's like. It's like a water jug that instead of, like, breaking, when the water fills up all the way, it just overflows the water out and just doesn't let any more water. So I'd rather waste water than either have the water level drop below the top of the glass. Or break the glass. If that makes sense. So it's almost like the faucet's always gone, and they just want to keep the glass exactly the same level. No matter what. If that means wasting energy, no problem. But it seems like it's designed, that it's. It's always sucking from something. Yeah. The other thing that you notice is maybe the key thing from the chart specifically is. If there is like this, this, this number that keeps popping up and if you place is called the global amplitude, which is what seems to be what they're calling the absolute, like, highest amount of energy. That the highest, the faucet is turned on, the most amount of water flowing, and then there is this, like, red line that's been drawn across and there's a blue line that goes right. And so the second red line, and it's sort of like tapers and plateaus, and then you see. It just starting to drop. Towards the dotted line. And whatever you thinks he's. He's understanding is that the batteries the cup is meant to fill to that second red line. And if it goes below the red line, that's where all these, like, question marks and panic is about. Like, what happens if the cup is no longer full? If, instead of getting rid of extra energy, we're now not getting the same amount of energy that we're used to getting. And then there is a bunch of questions about like, where is the Ash blood surge? Is one big question mark read right above, like where these. These two white projected dotted lines go. So he sees the Ash Blood Clan called out, and then there's several questions. Written on the board. Maybe a little more engineering than you're expecting to have tonight. Does it make sense? A little bit. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. I mean. Not big picture, but. I think he would probably. If it's too much information for him. For him to be able to remember. He would write them down, like whatever was written on there, so that he had this to refer back to. But I think if he's not fully able to interpret what it means anymore, he would move on. Okay. He's in, like, a gap. Okay, so about halfway through jotting down the board. Iggy just. Like he just gets. Me. Wait, hold on. I want to get this voice. Right. Hello? No, no. I have to talk a little bit before I get there. Yes, yes. No, slower, slower. Right here. Okay. Hello. Are you? I want it to be. I want it to be a slow Indian, but it's very hard. You're definitely not at the end. I know. I'm going to get there. Just a moment. Get that. Get there. Here I am. But slower. I'm going to try to talk slower. It's like whatever, okay? It's cosmetic. Hello. I have been watching you for a little while. Do you have? What have you learned? And he was looking at a large tortoise, basically, I think the master from Kung Fu Panda. And he's just, like, leaning on a little cane. He's got little, like, yaunty top hat, and he's very dapperly dressed. In a nice spiffy like Bridgerton style outfit. But as Zeggy looks a little bit closer, he can see he has dust all over his hands which matches the colors of the chalk that are on the board. And he has zero. Like, he looks almost like. He looks at you with a lot of curiosity and openness. No suspicion. Got. An interesting thing going. On over here. That's not. It's better than my Indian. That wasn't too bad. It's just hard to do it slow because then it turns into, like, Nordic. Yes, we are there. What we have built. I'm sorry. You are a student here. That is what I have. That's what I have been told as I walked in. Yeah. I guess I am. About the Panda 5. I don't. Know where. I am. Who you. Are. What this is. I listen it up here. But wow, we are learning a lot. Where are you from? I don't recognize your accent. We. Do not think of it. Oh, it did not mean to attend. I most apologetic. Forgive me. I only meant to say, if you are not that familiar with the Penda 5, are you from somewhere? Rural. Do you not have power? Let's. Just say. I'm not from around here. And I don't. Know these parts. But I'm. Learning. Very fast. What can you tell me? What is one thing you have learned so far? What do you like? Know? Yes, very much so. He kind of like, closes the door behind him and he says, I do not mean to interrogate you, but I saw the way that you are taking notes. And it was. I was thinking to myself, Maybe he is understanding. Well, of course I understand. You do. Maybe you can tell me what you think about the Ash blood search. I don't know nothing about no Ash Bloods. I just met the first two decks. But I do feel like you got a big give and take situation over here, and I don't know. My first Ash blood today. It was very exciting. It was a very nice. It was many of them, the very few in the total, which doesn't make sense because of that. Anyways, Sorry. Not. Don't get distracted. All. The hullabal. Oo about alf? Was. Why are you asking me about that? Well. Forgive me. I don't want to just lecture you, but it sounds like maybe. You could take some of your time to tell you about the resonator battery line. Well. Sure. Okay, how was his way over to the board? And he starts pointing at some of the drawings. And he says, let's just establish a couple of basic things here first. And then he kind of talks about the metaphor of the water. Not when he never fill the stuff that he's kind of already figured out. And then he starts talking about, well, over the past. Every major node. Every major node. Every major node. That has been integrated into harmony. It has brought with it a tremendous increase in global amplitude. But it has not happened yet for the Ashbluts or it happened a very little. It was very timely because if it did not happen, then with blood tool would have gone under the search line and all of the 10 to 5 batteries would have been outputting less than normal. It would have been the opposite of a Knight of Sparks, and it would have been very bad. Sorry. That probably did not make a lot of sense. I will rewind more. There is a reason this is my first year of teaching. Okay? Let us start with this. Do you know about the power of harmony? No. Okay. Well, Harmony, for a long time now, about a thousand years, has been a group of people that has gotten bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. But every time we integrate a new node, we all get a little bit stronger. And by all stronger, I mean specifically the Global implant. This is the amount of power that Harmony gives to its citizens. And everyone who gets joined unto harmony can access it through a resonator. And he points at the little satellite dish. That is on the corner of the battery. And he says, this is 500. We don't exactly know why it happens, but it is like the power of life, of connection. It is something that everyone can use, but only if you have some of the technology that the Guild did give us, which is my family, but whatever. I'm here on different sponsorships. Not to say important part. Comes from connection. All of the different nodes who are getting connected into harmony. Increase the path for as long as we go. He goes back to all these little hexes, little vertical lines on the graph. And each time this has major. There's like these big plus 100 major, plus 200 major. So we have only been measuring for maybe two, 300 years in the past, and every time we have had 100 or 200 increase to the global amplitude. And the Last one was 300, which was huge. That was when Goud stepped. That was Luke is forgetting the name, not Professor Conti. That is when one of the biggest last nodes was integrated prima with two crystals. Very exciting stuff. But the power of connection, the thing that makes the world run. How do you say. It is lonely. Maybe it really is powerful in the worlds. Sentience when the environment. Is alive in a specialist when there are people who talk. Some notes not so powerful, just vicious. They don't give us a whole lot. But there are other places around the world. That have given a whole lot. So in the ash blends. Came and they were integrated with their cooking work to all, and they became part of Harmony. We thought, oh, it was going to be a huge search, but they were just tiny. And I don't know why, because I'm here, my whole job, I am here to make sure that the surge that happens. Will not result in a second made of sparks, which was in the last artist happened, but before we had amber crystals, which meant that the entire world basically burned for, like, two months because there was too much power. Too much power. And so we had to build these. And he points to all the over engineered aspects of the battery that Iggy had noticed. It has always been the case that once you join the Harmony, you benefit from instant access to Harmony power. And that has been a great win for previous civilizations. But I do not understand why the hash plants, which should have been by all classifications. And he goes down the list of population, size, likeness of node like the sun node. That means this was a very easier energy to understand. It was not very complicated. Fire hit, we have other places that make fire heat. We switch, we done. But for some reason, Even though we see best of the glove, M3 is starting to increase again. There's just so much to teach. I feel like I am talking around in circles. But important parts are this. Had been so long since most previous known was discovered that the global amplitude was starting to decline. First time ever. It was going down. Never have I ever recorded for a prolonged period of time. Maybe two, three months, six months go down, but it always comes up. Except for it is time. The last 30 years, 40 years, continuing to go down. Not good. Not good for business, not good for harmony. So the ash buds were supposed to disable them is easy too. They also may hopefully save us. But they didn't. All they did was bring us back to less than where we were 50 years ago. Six years ago. So I think I'm going to lose my job now because I was supposed to build the next battery and the apex line is not even worth anything now because there is not enough surge. Because I feel like Iggy would be smart enough to understand this, but I don't know if I am. Yeah, read it back to me. I think. Always listening with the mindset of him trying to understand. The pressure changes in his home. And I think. I don't know if he should be suspicious. That however they're harvesting this power. Has been hurting potentially their clan, as well as obviously to Ash blood, because that would be a clear reason why they wouldn't be showing up. Is that other whatever Harmony is doing. They're hurting the resources. Or if harmony is also not extinct from an external factor. Like this external factor is happening and it's affecting and harmony. And I think. I don't know from that conversation if I feel like whatever they're building. Is the problem? Or if it's just measuring. Gotcha. So a question, A question that Iggy might ask is what happens when a node is not yet integrated? I think that the general vibe Iggy is getting is that there is nothing that Harmony is doing to pull anything from the Ash Bloods. They're not like a new source of oil that's being harvested. It's more similar. That Harmony is a ship with many ores on it. Some ores are pulled by really strong individuals that output a lot of power in. Some ores are smaller, like little fishing boat kind of tinkering guys. And basically, maybe that's an analogy that Conti would have given is basically what's happened is that the Ash Bloods have joined as a new oarsman on this boat. But instead of outputting like a big Goliath, it's outputting like a tiny child. And all the metrics say that it should have been as powerful as one of the biggest oarsmen on the ship. But for some reason it is not. And that is what super concerns Conte. Because he is the one who's supposed to guess how fast the ship is going to be able to go with all the oresmen on it. And now he can't because one of the big critical math is off. But the other part of the metaphor that I think Iggy would have gotten is the ship. All of the oarsmen on the ship are at the end of the round, the same. They just happen to output more power. So there's maybe two things that Iggy would be confused about is one. Why am I getting affected if I'm not on the boat yet? Why are we feeling these pressure changes? If we haven't integrated into the Harmony ship yet. Because there's, like, this very specific exchange that has to happen between the energies. That Conte's theories. And you get the impression that he's a little bit of one of those genius scientists who doesn't agree with the rest of the population at the time. Like Galileo. While he was alive. Not while he was dead. Yeah. And so his theories are all based off of it is about the connection between people. S. They exchange that happens between the Ash. Blood and Harmony were about exchanging that same energy for the same purpose which built the connection between the world. But the trains haven't done anything like that. There's been no. And it's very obvious to everyone around things immediately change as soon as that connection is done. Like Ash bleds, the stories that icke has heard so far is that they were experiencing an increase to their volcano island temperatures. This might have been research that, well, he hasn't really had. A chance to learn this stuff yet. But maybe just from some of the conversation with Ignatius. They were experiencing some of these fluctuations before integration. Into harmony. But as soon as it was integrated, it was a spike. A spiked difference. And they always talk about it in the terms of heat. There was the great cooling. Things started to kind of flutter and heated up like embers. And then after Harmony joined, it became very warm again, like the island started to feel like it was becoming alive. And so that's why the Ash blood claim is so interested in Harmony and so happy with them, is because they're great. Cooling is now reversed. And from their perspective, it's just they're on the climb. Okay? So I. Guess. Is he walking away from this conversation feeling like. Harmony. Is truly trying to solve. Like trying to solve. And like this situation or is like harmony. The enemy. I mean, it's like they're trying to figure out. Everybody's asking the same questions and they'll see it from the answer. It's not necessarily harmony of the institution as possible. Yeah, I think that's probably a good assumption for Iggy to have built. And he doesn't know a lot about harmony, but he does know Conte, who seems, I think, strikes a little bit of a kindred soul as a bit of an outsider. But he's well dressed. He's clearly normal member of society. But I don't think. Iggy. Yeah? I think the thing you said, the best. That was best. There's something that Harmony doesn't understand either about this energy. And they seem to have an entirely different problem. But a similar, different problem. So basically. Connection, literally meaning? Connecting to group. How. Yeah, I think this might be, like, a part that we can role play, because I think that'd be the thing that he does not understand at all, of everything. And so, like, if maybe Conte's last thing is, like, we don't understand the connection between the people who seem so strong, it was. A great integration and the volcano became very odd. But the global Emanto did not. Oh, my God. That. Kind of forgot you were still here. What? If there's group. S do. Not like them, Azizi. Very interesting question. We have no idea what they do. It was not as easy as fire. Fire easy. You just bring more fire. Problem solved. The time is easy. They don't die. So how do we. Connect with the people who do not die. What? They die, but therefore not die. They don't die. You should talk to them as easy about death. It is very interesting. I have only had a very, very short conversation with the dean. Some assistant is very enlightening. She did not very much like it there, because that's why she came here. But anyways, not to talk too much about him. They die. They will tell you all about it. And they don't die, they might kill you. Because death is a part of life. I think at the end of the day, you are always saying, But they are forest does not die unless they make it die Is the best. I understand. It. So we have solved the many weapons so that they could destroy their forest. Killing your mom? I don't know. It doesn't have to make any sense to me. But that was what we thought. Maybe if we helped them destroy the forest, that would blow the connection. Like people, the history of violence in some places. So it would have been very possible to go into violence and harmony and maybe. A hunt or something of this nature with the same weapon that they were using. That has not worked. And. It is proving to be quite difficult to form this connection. Very different things. I have a theory. I have a theory that it is the way that the environment has shaped the people who live in it. And if you can take that part, that essential part of what makes a cultural and you can connect it with what makes a mad agriculture, then it bridges the divides between two people who do not have otherwise understand? I think of two tribes far, far away. Both of which have discovered five at the same time. No other languages in common. I have a suspicion that one of the first things they would say. Is they would teach each other the word for phylum because it is easy to see, it is easy to connect in this connection, this first word between peoples. Maybe that is the secret, finding a way to communicate about something so internal to your culture. But it is not always. It is not usually fire. There's something that Terra gives us. There's not something we give Terra. So we have to understand ourselves in order to make that connection. The volcanoes of dash plans. They are very in tune to these volcanoes Tell. Them that that's not always true. The Mazizi, perhaps. They do not never stand. We certainly don't. Exchange that thing if that's something that he can talk freely about the exchange, right? That would be. What Iggy knows is that the exchange happens between clans. Whether or not. If he's talking about connection being so important. I think iggy. By. Iggy. I mean, me thinking, like, if. This connection and knowing whether. Cultures are so important. Why does exchange happen where the person has to be forced to forget? Connection with important and learning about everything's culture. Were destroying connection. I think that's a really good insight for Iggy to ask. Iggy hasn't had enough time to know what Harmony's culture is and what they do and don't do, so that'd be up to Iggy to decide if. Potentially this thing that he knows is the clans. Does he want to talk about? Because probably few people know that this thing exists. Exchange. Yeah, that's a pretty niche. Once every three years. Five years thing that happens in the clans. Well, how would I know? He doesn't know Harmony. Yeah, so. And that's probably true for a lot of things. For iggy. There are certain cultural norms and expectations. That. How would he learn exactly? So I don't know what he does with that insight. I mean, I think he would. That seems to have made you think of something. Knowing where you're from. And embracing. Where? I'm from. I don't. Know if it's normal. Or not. There. Is this thing called. The exchange. The exchange. I have not heard of this. Introduces somebody new. But. We don't know. Whether. They're not able to tell. Us. The. Definite. Connection. Just said so. It made me think. Very interesting. If I gave you a map, would you be able to show me which part of Harmony you're from? I very, very much want to know how. I did not mean. That is the second time. Forgive me. It is very. There are some very small sects in harmony. Sex in harmony. I have heard. Not as integrated with the rest of society, but they still use the Harmony resonator batteries. You must be from a very special place, but also one that I don't think I would want to live in. If you don't mind me saying. The connection between people is very important and not knowing it is causing me physical pain. Not to ask you where you're a firm or because I want to build this connection with you, it is very important. It's how we grow up. It's. Very important. To. Our text. Each other. And. We don't. Think the west. Ward. Danger from Aether beasts. What type of danger? Deadpan. Your home. Sounds like a very hard place to live. If I mean quite honest, there is not, as far as I know and I know, but I think good about history. And he kind of like starts sliding his hand down the x axis of the chart. Past like the ash. Blood green line. Passport 84 10. 363 30. The last major conflict. Between peoples was hundreds of years ago we left on this chart. So the only other. Perhaps. I do not want to undermine our connection. Hypothesizing. What are you from. But there are other places in the veil, in the vein. The vein who are responsible. For guarding our borders from very serious threats. Especially when the amplitude started to decline, the threats got very real. So I do understand this need for protection. But. Maybe I'll leave you with this. It is hard to defend Malal. The thing that makes Harmony is able to defend from the Ether beasts was the connections between the other planets. The iron from the sinter. This might actually be a good lock. The chime, spiders from the guild did the life, soil from the felt land, the trail tales from the trench, the knees to silent silt, Elysium snows then all of these are very important to defending. And that don't know that they would have been able to do it alone. This may be something that if you ever find the other way back to your clan, You can see there. I would very much like it if you had come back for more. Next time, have tea. Oh, you have an inferior treat. And you like, sort of pat you on the back and starts ushering you towards the door. It will be the hot honey soothing your very, very happy entire student. But it is now late, and you do need to get back to the bonfire and your friends. Martha here, she will take you out. And he's not moving very quickly. So you have plenty of time to talk a few more times if you wanted to, but you slowly starting to work your way towards the door. I think. Like the. Cogs are turning. He is less. Conversation like very conf. Used. Because he's been told his whole life. Like connection with the outside world. Would make his world. Die, ultimately, that that was the end of life and that this person is telling me that. The complete opposite. I think he's just. Very confused. I think that's, like, a pretty good place for you to catch back up with the group. What would Iggy do the rest of the night? Do you think it'll be the last thing before we. Going to sit with his journal and try to figure out if he can fix the battery. I think he's gonna. He's creating models with his little things and trying to fix. The questions that were on the board because I think he needed to. Put his hands on something. Like, he can't sort out the connection piece right now, but he's, like, entering to figure out how to make this little battery thing more efficient. They're fucking heavy. So even if you wanted to take one out, he might not have been able to. I know that's not what you're saying, but if. Maybe the last thing is. If you have a one to come and experiment in malaboratory, you're very, very welcome. I would very much like to have a second mind. The other ones like it to fix things. They don't like to think about them. And I can tell you, like, two things. I would like that. He says. I'll give you one at the and he gives you a small black crystal. To put in your hand. He says this is an under. A fine. Under Christophe, the same thing. Resonator, Sergers. And he points into the battery center. And as you can, like, compare the crystal in your hand, To the matrix that makes up the battery. You realize it's the same. This thing is integral to the way the battery is designed. And really, we shouldn't be using the word battery. We should be more like using the word receptor. Because it's not storing any energy. It is just. Yeah, it is all its entire job is to take energy and cap it and output a consistent energy. Because the amplitude is always fluttering up and down, up and down, up and down. So it does store a little. I guess it stores a little bit of energy for, like, the small dibs. But that's not what it's for. It's mostly just acting as a search. Like a surge capacitor. I think he just would. Like. I think he would take that model, and I think a lot of what he does is sketch out ideas first. So I think he would go back and he'd have some versions of the model to put his hands on it, then he'd go back. He's trying to solve, like, the unsolved. Okay? Yeah. And I think if he did that at his bunk or by the door, it would be easy to catch them when they come back. Or the other thing is, he could be just outside and at some point, the rest of the group will have walked by the bonfire and then you will have seen them going out. They seem to be going out for late, late night drinks at Fancy Club. So they haven't really dressed up, but they're all like, that's. That's the direction they're going. Everyone else has already come back, and Iggy is up late, steady, like, not studying kind of studying. And he sees his new folks like dawn fire and then heading out for more. More party. Okay? I think maybe. I mean, he would join them. Early because I know he needs to get back, but I think he could be like, Well. This next, huh? Test it out. Trying to distract himself from. Conversation about connection. In his head to test it out, too, because he's never tested out to match him with others. Nice. Like a little experiment that he. That little question mark would be like, maybe the reason why he said, He, like, scratched down, like, five experiments he could run to test conviction throughout the night with the people. Okay, perfect. Yeah, that's a nice crossover. I appreciate the assist. Co. Ol? Well, I guess you got to go back to work tomorrow. Which is lame. So nice not having to work. But, like, also, we go to New York very soon, right? Yeah. Have you? Christina still hasn't gotten her dress. I need to buy. I was thinking I was going to buy, like, a black turtleneck to wear under my gray suit. And be like, I know you guys said fancy, but. I know. Marie is, like, going red carpet. Well, not ready carpet, more like. I think I. You know, it hasn't. Come yet. I don't. Know why. It. Got stuck. Because I was trying to order a dress that I would say I could wear for John's wedding. Nice. Yeah, but I ordered. This situation. Is that drexy enough? I think that's dressing up. And you're probably going to have, like, a coat over it anyways. Yeah, I have a beacon. Yeah. That'll be good. Yeah. And see if I have Christine. It doesn't work, I'm just going to end up getting. Just a black. Yeah, that's basically, I think Christina's last one was. Well, this is the potential AI Edition of not her dress, but of what I'm wearing. Oh, my gosh. Paternal neck. Yeah. Just kind of go for something like Malfoy. And then I was like, this was the picture of the location is us at the wedding. And I was like, well, make her look like Bella drinks. Oh. My God. That's hysterical. Yeah. Pretty funny. Hilar. Ious. Yeah. No. I think I would know. You're probably. That. Dress. But. I might preserve the right to pivot. Yeah, I know. Marie, you have flowers on there, which is great. She wants. Like I know you're not really. Walking to wedding. But this is mostly. Yeah, I think we're all. Yeah, that work we're going for. Very Slytherin Southern vibes. This. Is probably. Raven. Bias. Not. Hustle. Bus by any means. Eye. Ball. Red. Maroon. So that would be a little bit more. A tvd. I'll probably go whenever. This. When are you guys coming? In. Again. Sunday. Yeah. That's when I extended the hotel. I didn't know if you guys were. Coming in. Or not. Yeah, we just got. Our I listed for standby on the way there, and that's looking pretty good. And we'll fly into LaGuardia. And I think we land in laguardia. To like 2pm Eastern time. I don't get. Into gotcha. And then we'll fly out. We fly out of Newark. At 2 Eastern. Okay? I get in? At like, 9pm. And then. I fly out. At like 5:30. Yep. Pretty easy transpile there. 's san diego. At noon. 9:00pm. It could be worse. It feels like going that way. I like flying to the East Coast. I like flying back in the East. Yes. Yeah. I. Know, I'm, like, kind of bummed. I leave? 5:30. But I still get back at 9pm. Fast. Lay enough. That is kind of. And that's coming back this way. It changed my client. They changed it. Leaving San diego at, like 1:13. Just so random. And then I don't fit in Today's case, like 9.5. That's going the wrong way. Maybe I'll look. At it. Why do you. I hate. It's like a classic Delta thing. I feel like. Where they adjust. Bite my leg. 30 to 45 minutes. Cool. Either way. I guess I'll see you guys. On Sunday night. Yeah. We don't have any plans. We're going to. We leave. At? Yeah, yeah, we get like two Eastern, I think. It gets me in at 3:30. That's not terrible. 7, 89. That's an early day. But laundry. In new york. Yeah. Sleep on the plane. If you could. Yeah. We arrive at 2:00pm local time. Okay? Cool. Yeah, maybe. I'll see if I can switch this, then. 4am wake up call. 7:30 for 7:30 flight. Or 7am. Seven. A m. Leave here. Like the latest I should leave. My house is 5:30. Technically, because I get like 5am in bulk. Preduck everything. Yeah. It could. Be worse. Could be worse. I'd always rather have better. Like have the chance to relax and sleep well once I'm there. When I leave. Yeah, because I feel like if I. If I land at, like. 10. And then leaving JFK at the book. There's, like, nothing like it's going to be that. It's a waste day for sure. Points a day. All right, let me see. I like. I don't use Delta enough to know. Should be pretty obvious. Unless you only book like economy. And then you said to guys, please. Sorry. You leave at 2 on Wednesday. We leave out of Newark. Four local time. Okay, so. That's, like, right around. The same time. Want more options, treat yourself to an upgrade. Continue. With. Be designed after tap in. Cannot change these needs. Sign after check. In. Select seat. We have one, so I'm going to select. Euro dollars. Complet. E. Why does this feel so easy, like I'm not being charged anything? Just costing 4,000 miles. Work. S for me. Four thousand miles is nothing. I. Know. I'm just adding you to my calendar invite that you have. It. On your calendar for our. Wow, that was far too easy. Select. Anything but a middle. Ware. That window looks great. Costing. Mode. Because it's going to cost me. More. How. Much like the. Like it's telling me. I need to select sleep. Then every seat that I slept, it costs more. You can't skip. Wait. It's going to auto assign me. Yeah, I just let it auto assign you and if there's no free ones, you can click let it auto assign you. And then go change it. Only free ones. Are milk. That would risk the auto assign. Yeah. Okay? Seven. Am. I mean, it's. Cool. Okay, well, then I only get in like an hour later, and I'm coming from jfk, so I typically will be around the same time if everything goes according to Luke. Yeah, yeah, I find it from Luke already on that one. And then we're going to get. Should be pretty good. The only thing that we're going to go look at a wedding band at some point. Because they have a brick and mortar store. There, which would be really good if they have the one that she's looking for. If not, which we have backup plan here in New York. Wait, where? The place I bought the ring went from their base out of New York. They gotta, gotta, got it. They have a. You know, platinum and white gold don't go together. So finding a platinum that she likes is. Oh, my gosh. When you said wedding ban, I'm thinking music, I was like, you're gonna try out? A band. Oh, my God. I. Was so confused. Yeah. That's so funny. I had the exact same thing happen to me when mom was like. So, do you have your wedding band picked out? I was like, how dj. No, honey. Was not. Thinking. Christina got this the other day. Oh, nice. Just like simple gold. Yeah. I got that. But you got the little frame to put it in. Cute. Yeah. It's heavy. It's actually kind of fun. It's tungsten with just, like, a 14. Not your van. You. Went with gold. Simple gold. You were looking at so many options. I was. And all that. I think it might be something I accessorize. Yeah. I mean, I know a lot of guys that actually wear a bunch of different ones. Just. Yeah, kind of. Why not? Christina. I probably would have gotten a silver one, but she liked the gold because it's something I don't normally wear. You know what? That's fair. It should in some ways be different than the rest of my wardrobe. Cool. Exciting. Yep. Yep. I. Ordered. Mar. IA actually delegated something to me. Dude, she is out of control. She is out of control, isn't she? You know? I'm typing in a lot of ways. But definitely not the extent she is. She's next level Type A. She is next level Type A. And then it's this weird with both of us being like, co mage of honor situations. Yeah. But, like, obviously, Marie is known Christina so much. I don't want her to feel like I'm not doing anything, but I also don't want to step on. Her toes. Yeah. So that's. I'm like, I haven't. Really figured exactly. But. I'm cute. Yeah. I hear you. Microsoft. Decided to try. Download something in it. Anyways. I didn't. Haven't really known my. Role in the whole bachelor situation, and, like, I want to be helpful. But again. Someone is step on her toes or, like, if she wants to do it, I'm happy to. Showing up. But she delegated some decor stuff for me. To do. Which is like what I would prefer to do anyways. Decoration. So I ordered. Christina's not there. Is she? No, she's not. Okay? She wanted to do, like. A book themed. Bachelorette casino would into ordered. It's like a Grimm's book. A fairy tales. You know that one? And I'm basically making all my decor like I'm making all of the decor out of those cases. She gave me the theme. Like. Last chapter before the happily ever after. I, like, have been looked up. Looked up. All these, like, things to make. And are made from, like, book pages. And then I was like, well, I can't do. I went to Goodwill yesterday, and I was looking for, like, I was a Goodwill and this other thrift store looking for books. That I could, like, rev up to make it. I was like, you can't just use any book because it's got to have good juju. Yeah, I love that. I. Like our wedding table markers are going to be pages. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you're tracking that? Yeah, you should also do. Because she had a really hard time deciding between which, like, theme to go through. Because there's that one. There's also. Yeah, there's. There's, like, five other bookish taglines in it, depending on how you imagine your decor. I could see you, like, doing all of them. In some minor way. Something about. The witch and her coven. I did see a very funny one. That made me think of you guys. It was kind of like Renaissance, like something about her. Her mischief something. A mischief something. I have to look him up, but I'll send you the little tagline. S. That she liked. Yeah. I'll say I definitely am planning on making. It. Better. No. Just give it a second to focus, maybe. Closer. There you go. Yeah. That's cool. You need to save some of these because we're not used to at the wedding. Well. I was kind of thinking. That when. I was. Yeah, just a bunch of stuff. But then I'm going to make a banner. I was. Going to say something. Cool. Yeah. Then you should do the, you know, the quest line or whatever it was, the one that Marie told you that she had selected. That'd be a good one to after before the halfway of record. Yeah, that's the one that Christina told me. And that's why I was like, well, then I needed. I was like, okay, then I should just buy stuff halfway ever after. Story. Yeah, that's nice. I almost was like, I was looking for, like, torn as, like, an old Harry Potter. Or like books that I knew she liked. And then I couldn't find any, so that I was looking for, like, ones that at least have love and the title or something. Because, you know, like, it's like the title is on the top of every page. And I was like, that's still not. I still can't find any. And so I was like, okay. Then I'm just gonna get these. Yeah, that's great. But, yeah, same thing if you've heard of her talking about anything. Because I don't want to show her too much other than, like, she told me that, and I was like, hey, great, I can run with that. But. I want her to like there might be surprise. I guess my other I got to figure out. Like going back and forth. I should drive or not? Because. Flying to Phoenix needs to drive two hours. Yeah. Versus and then I'd have to, like, if I want to make decor and I don't want to get smushed and stuff. Yeah. And then having a car while you're there would obviously be useful. I think we're going to have to get rent a car anyways. And we had like, just like, there's six people. It's just enough people that. UberXL is only really solution. Yeah, well, I mean, they're going to have to rent a car, but it's like you're almost having to rent two cars with that many people. Wonder if you could. Like I could drive semiautolite. It's technically, like, seven hours. For me, which isn't horrible. Would you want to be interested in renting, like, a nice minivan and then driving that down? And to keep the miles off of your car for one. 2 because you have to rent a car anyway, and 3 would have something for decoration in. No. I feel like I would either just drive my car. Or fly and rent a bit like a big SUV or mini van where I could fit all of us there. Like, I don't feel like renting a car and driving from here. I mean, my car has, like, such little miles on it to begin with. Yeah, it's more just about not having extra shit that you don't need, and then you could fly back. Which might be kind of nice. I like to see what you're saying. Yeah. I feel like a rental cars always stress me out a little bit. Like being in charge of a rental car. Sure. So I feel like. I feel if I'm going to do that big of a drive, I probably just want to do it in my own car. Yeah. It's about being comfortable and not driving a bigger car than you're used to. Exactly. But if it was a nice mini game, it might drive itself and. My nightmares. Yeah, I think, like, even if we got as many, I mean, I guess it has a three. It should fit eight. I don't know. Yeah, it wouldn't fit everything with luggage, but at least you know you want to go out to dinner. You can all pile. I think just regardless. People will have to fly in. We. 've been. Like I have to drive, which would add time. Yeah, if I ran it. So it would just be better for me to fly and rent the car there. Or just me drive separately? Part of me was leaning towards driving separately so I could get there early enough to put decorations up. While they were dealing with control of your own schedule. Yeah, but then I just don't know how. I have a feeling where we would want to be involved in the decorating of things and checking in. I don't know. I can't quite feel her at all. You'll never feel like you filter out. I always felt. Like. I was nervous about insulting her, and then she would destroy me. I was a little bit intimidated by, by the relationship. Like, it was never scared of her, but I was always scared that I would ruin the relationship with her by saying something, whatever. But I actually, I think she really enjoys when people have opinions and can, like, give and take SaaS a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So I wouldn't be too nervous. And she cares about the stuff that matters, when it matters. So if you're like, hey, you know, I think I want to do this thing, or I got to set up stuff, I'll send you pictures. I want you to be involved. She's going. To be like, okay, I got it. Your code made of honor, too. I don't need to be if I'm on the polls of every single little thing. She also, despite doing Christina a lot longer, Wants to do her bachelor party. She wants to do Marie's bachelorette party. Yeah, that's fair. And I know Christina kind of says, like, I'm hoping that you can keep it kind of what I want. Like, because I know Corey initially really wanted to make and want to do, like. And so I was glad I texted Christina and I was like, give me things you absolutely do not want to do the things you do. And, like, one of her. Because Marie really wants to play games and do all the things. And Christina's like, I'm not a game person. I would love to not play games. So I was like, okay, so that's helpful, because come up the court games, or we can just not do that. Yeah, we were sort of joking around, but I'm also sort of serious. That, like, the only game that you should play is a puzzle if you want to do. Yeah, I mean, I thought I was, like, I could bring. Like a green games but not like the get to know you. She would kill us if we did. Because we did talk about doing a little mini shower for her. So like having gift for her. Is she going to be okay with that? Yeah, she'd be fine with that as long as she can get him back. Which she should. Depending on the flight situation. She'll probably be assuming that she is just going to fly standby, which means that she'll have a carry on and a personal item. Like, no big items, correct? Yeah, little stuff. She. I think that would be. She'd be totally cool with that. Yeah, okay. But yeah, like, just. A. A really chill vibe. Something that people can chat and hang out is fine. But, like, if you, if there was something in the book that you. Wanted to cut your own puzzle pieces into. I think she, like, she would actually. She would rather do just a basic puzzle than play a game. I don't know that she really wants to do a puzzle, per se. I'm just going to give you, like. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the level of engagement. It's more of an activity that, like, we can do as a group, but not, like a cringey bachelorette activity. She does not. Want to compete. She does not want to work individually. She wants to be a part of. A. Graph. Like what a. Craft be a good a thing. Yeah. I think depending on the craft, like, I was thinking about a wine and paint. A wine and paint can be kind of fun if y'all did, like, a little tiny canvas that you could take. She loves her wine and paints that she has here. Yeah, it's like little paint by numbers kind of thing. You mean? Yeah. Or just like, everyone draw this centerpiece. Or here's a picture. Everyone draw that. And if she can use that in some way in the wedding, those are kind of cool effects. I'll think about it. Yeah, think if there's, like, an activity. Or something that. You. But that's helpful to know. But more of just like an activity we can do that's non competitive. Just more of like can create community and. Yeah, you can drink and play. Okay. Yeah. Then it's not an individual performance based or anything. Got it. I mean, I know Marie is definitely, like, looking at. A spa situation, which I think would be great. I think it's a lot of just, like, height. Like, she's put down a couple trails to, like, she wants to hike. Yeah, I think. When I was in D.C. there were some people that had been to Sedona a bunch, and they. They really recommended the Pink Jeep tour. Which is exactly what it sounds like. Off road through Sedona and a pink jeep. I don't know that there. There might have, like, a tour guide up there who's sort of funny and chirpy. And then there was I. She. She forwarded the list to Marie. But I'll just send it to you just so that. You have it. There's a couple of restaurants on it. I think it was the other things. Okay? Started raining again. Right. I need to thank you. Yeah, I think. I didn't see any other opportunities like paid activities on the itinerary. Marie fit out other than the. Spa. I think the rest was just hiking and. Rest. Aurants. But. If you are getting the sense that she would be, she would want to do. Another. Activity. I'll ask her. Like the pink. The pink Jeep tour was recommended from. I was sitting at the end of the table with the moms of the group, basically, and they were really recommending me it as a fun vibe. A mix of, like, we thought we were going to die, and also, we just had a good time. I still think that atb we did. And Sedona was, like, the funnest. One of the. Funnest vacation activities I've ever done. Yeah, that was great. And she loves. She loves snowmobiling. She doesn't. She doesn't love driving. But she will drive. So she would choose. I think she'd enjoy being, like, a sidecar in atv, but I think she also was hanging out with people. Also the Pink Jeep tour, where you're all kind of crammed in and you go to this, like, bumpy ride, safari ride. Might at least be more like you. Too. I do know. Christine. And I are baby marie. Said, like finances may or may not be. Tight. For some of her bridesmaids or the people that are coming. So. I think. I'm almost wondering. If I could hate activity. I'm willing to do whatever. But I didn't know. Yeah. Priorit. Izing a paid activity. This fall was the one. Marie's pretty. She. She loves doing good, and she loves being seen to do good. But it doesn't matter because she's still doing good, but she's, like, trying to pay for a couple of them. And I was telling Christina that she should not pay for their travel or lodging, but do one more excursion than you wouldn't normally do and help cover the cost of that. Yeah. For what that's worth. And Christine and I might pitch in under the hood. Too. If there's something that's. If there's something that she wants to do, we're going to figure out a way to do it. If I have to pay for it and we don't tell Marie because then Marie will have to pay for five things or whatever. Well in ireland. I almost text. Ed marie, and I was like, I. 've been a lot of bachelore. Ts for, like, the uk for the rideshare. If we do that, and then. I. 'm happy to pay more. Do what she wants to do. Yeah. Have I told you about the only thing I think I told you? The thing I'm thinking about doing with the helmets. Besides printing them about people wearing them. And if I catch you with your helmet off, then now you're splitting the bill with me. So it's like if they want me to not pay, they're going to have to earn it. Yeah. I think. I get it. Like. All of the weddings. Up in canada. Yeah. It's just like, Christina and I are in a pretty good place right now, so I'd rather her be able to have our friends out there, people out there, and do one more fun thing that's memorable, not that. You have to buy stuff to have a good time. Well, marie. I feel like. She asked me how I thought about the price. I was like, less than 200 person. Come on. Ask you. Yes, I was expecting. Like 500. We can do. Whatever. I know. Christina did say that. She was, like, feeling overwhelmed. With things. So, like, I'm trying. i don't want to
