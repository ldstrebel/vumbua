# Gemini Notes
* **Character Backstory for Iggy**: The conversation shifted to fleshing out the character Iggy, confirming that his parents were on the council, which is how he found the tablet, and that he was a loner who is now drawing unexpected attention due to his oddness and high test scores. Holly Strebel suggested Iggy secretly enjoyed the company, quickly descending from the crane when invited to a party.

* **Iggy's Motivation and Current Actions**: Holly Strebel clarified that Iggy's ultimate goal is to gather information to help his home and people, even though they previously ignored him, suggesting he would leave a group if something more important appeared. Luke S. suggested two possible hooks that would draw Iggy away from the group: seeing Ignatius (another student) excited about lighting a fire, or seeing the doors to the power plant (Vimua power) open briefly, revealing whirring cogs and machinery.

* **Exploring the Academy Campus and Power Plant**: Holly Strebel decided that Iggy would attend the bonfire briefly, then Irish goodbye to head towards the power plant to explore the room with all the equipment. Luke S. noted that Iggy, due to his short stature, dark cloak, and naturally sneaky nature, would likely be unnoticed as he entered the power plant, which is an action they may need to change his class abilities to support.

* **Potential Character Skills (Hope and Stress)**: Luke S. suggested incorporating a "stress" mechanic where Iggy's sneaky skills are passively activated when they feel stressed, leading to a eventual crash, or a "hope" mechanic where they spend hope (gained from dice rolls) to intentionally influence the earth to achieve their hyper-focused goals. Holly Strebel preferred the hyperfixation and hope mechanic, though they acknowledged both could be used.

* **Entry and Encounter in the Power Plant**: Iggy walked right into the power plant, assuming no one would stop them, and encountered a short, feminine, bearded gnome named Tommy sitting behind a desk. Iggy made to walk away after a brief, awkward exchange, and then a burly dwarf in mechanic overalls named Lucy questioned Tommy about letting a student through.

* **Exploring the Power Plant Interior**: Iggy walked past the lobby and onto a catwalk that overlooked a large warehouse filled with turbines powered by glowing gems. The catwalk also led to an office space with a cabinet full of the glowing gems and a chalkboard covered in scribbles, which Iggy recognized as relating to some of the machinery they are drawing. Iggy planned to start drawing from the catwalk, eventually making their way down to the ground floor.

* **Investigating the Office and Chalkboard Drawings**: Holly Strebel, speaking as Iggy, expressed that they would enter the office to compare their drawings with the ones on the chalkboard, specifically to see if any details were missed, but would not copy others' work outright because they trust their own detailed observations. Luke S explained that two drawings are in the office: the "Panda 5 resonator battery" on the left and some scribbles on the right side of the chalkboard. Iggy confirmed that the closest thing they have drawn so far is the battery-looking object with a handle and antenna.

* **The Panda 5 Resonator Battery Details**: Luke S described the Panda 5 drawing, noting that a blue box with arrows inside appears to represent glowing gems, which are like car batteries plugged into panels downstairs. The battery contains an internal matrix of hexagons and triangles that glows softly, and while Iggy could read all the terms, they would not understand what most of the terms mean. Iggy, after rolling a successful knowledge check (22 with hope), was able to get a good amount of learnings from the drawings and objects.

* **Observations on Battery Engineering and Energy Source**: Iggy noticed that the glowing objects in the filing cabinet were extremely well-built but also overbuilt, suggesting they contain a force much larger than what is within them. These batteries seem to be the source of all movement, replacing coal or gasoline, and multiple batteries are needed for bigger tasks. Iggy understood that the system is designed to capture energy, constantly maintaining a set threshold, like a water jug that continuously overflows to prevent the level from dropping or the jug from breaking.

* **Analysis of the Energy Chart and Decline**: Iggy observed a chart featuring a "global amplitude" number, which seems to represent the absolute highest amount of energy flow, like the faucet being fully turned on. A red line marks the intended fill level of the battery cup, and if the level drops below this line, it causes panic and question marks. The chart shows concern about the "Ash Blood Surge," and the Ash Blood clan is explicitly called out on the board.

* **Introduction of Kante, the Tortoise-like Character**: Iggy was interrupted while taking notes by a large, dapperly dressed tortoise-like figure named Kante, who asked them, "Hello. Who are you?" and what they had learned. Iggy observed that Kante had chalk dust on their hands, suggesting they had been working on the board, and showed zero suspicion toward Iggy. Iggy shared that they do not know where they are, who Kante is, or what the place is, but they are "learning a lot".

* **Discussion of Harmony and the Resonator Battery Line**: Kante asked Iggy if they understood the Panda 5 and the "Ash Blood Surge," which prompted Iggy to discuss the current "give and take situation" that needs fixing. Kante began lecturing Iggy about the resonator battery line, using the metaphor of the water jug (or glass) that should not overfill. Kante explained that every time a new "node" has been integrated into Harmony, the "global amplitude," or available power, has increased tremendously, but the Ash Blood integration only resulted in a small surge.

* **The Ash Blood Surge Discrepancy and the Great Cooling**: Kante clarified that Harmony's power comes from connection, with each new connected node making the global amplitude stronger for its citizens. The Ash Blood integration should have caused a huge surge but only resulted in a tiny one, which concerns Kante because they feared the amplitude would drop below the surge line, causing a "second night of sparks" which had been disastrous in the past. Iggy considered whether Harmony's method of harvesting power might be hurting other clans, but Kante clarified that Harmony does not harvest energy but acts like a ship with multiple oarsmen, with the Ash Bloods unexpectedly rowing like a child instead of a giant.

* **The Concept of Connection and the Exchange**: Kante explained that the power comes from the connection between peoples and the environment, which they believe is what builds energy in Harmony. Iggy raised the issue of "the exchange," where new people are introduced to the clan but are forced to forget their origins, which contradicts the stated importance of connection and learning other cultures. Kante claimed to have not heard of this "exchange" and suggested that Iggy's home, which enforces such secrecy, sounds like a hard place to live.

* **The Trench Clan's Dilemma and the Umbra Crystal**: Kante implied that the current threat level, likely from "aether beasts," necessitates collective defense through connections, which Iggy's clan must consider if they ever return home. Iggy expressed confusion because they were taught that connection with the outside world would cause their world to die, the complete opposite of what Kante is saying. Kante gave Iggy an unrefined Umbra crystal, which is integral to the battery's design and is actually a resonator/receptor, not a battery, as its primary function is to cap energy and output consistent energy.

* **Iggy’s Intentions and Departure**: Iggy decided they would sit with their journal to sketch out models and try to solve the unsolved questions on the board, focusing on making the "battery thing" more efficient, as they cannot currently sort out the connection piece. Seeing the rest of the group leaving for late-night drinks, Iggy decides to join them to test out the theory of "connection with other people and culture," turning it into an experiment.
