## GM Narration [NOT YET REVEALED TO PLAYERS]

> [!CAUTION]
> The following information has been narrated by the GM but is not known to the player characters.

### Backstory
Son of a farmer whose land was "stitched" into an industrial zone during integration. He's been hungry since he was six years old.

### Bond
His mother's copper cooking spoon, which he carries in his boot.

### Flaw
Cowardice. He will betray almost anyone for a hot meal.

### Planning Notes
In the lore dump, Pudge was hovering near the Mizizi Help Desk---not for the math, but because he realized the Mizizi bring "Life-Capsules" (concentrated nutrients) that Harmony doesn't track as food.
