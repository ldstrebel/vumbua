# Seraphina "Serra" Vox

> "I'm an ally. Is that okay to say?"
> — *Serra*, trying too hard.

**Aliases:** Serra Vox, Serra
**Role:** Squad 01 (The Echelon) - Bard (Gold Rank)
**Affiliation:** Harmony (Vox Family), Vumbua Academy
**Status:** Active

## Overview
Known to most students as **Serra Vox**, a slightly awkward but enthusiastic history buff who wants to be an "ally" to the new clans. In reality, she is **Seraphina Vox**, the youngest daughter of Arch-Duke Cymon Vox, the energy magnate of Harmony.

## Personality
- **Public Persona (Serra Vox):** Eager, nervous, and fascinated by the Clans (almost to the point of fetishization). She asks slightly inappropriate questions but means well.
- **True Self (Seraphina Vox):** A highly skilled Bard with an "airy, ethereal" voice. She is chasing the "Primal Song" of a Shattered Node to prove herself. She hides her identity to avoid the pressure of her father's name.

## Motivations
- **The Primal Song:** She believes the Clans hold the key to a lost magic (the "Drivers") that can restore the Primal Song.
- **Rebellion:** Hiding as "Serra Vox" is her way of rebelling against the rigid expectations of House Vox.

## Relationships
- **Valerius Sterling:** Her squad captain. He knows her secret and protects it, but finds her fascination with the "Uncalibrated" clans dangerous.
- **Ignatius:** Skeptical of her "ally" persona ("I don't trust this b*tch").
