# Seraphina "Serra" Vox

> "I'm an ally. Is that okay to say?"
> --- *Serra*, trying too hard.

**Aliases:** Serra Vox, Serra
**Role:** Squad 01 (The Echelon) - Bard (Gold Rank)
**Affiliation:** Harmony (Vox Family), [[Vumbua Academy]]
**Status:** Active

## Overview
Known to most students as **Serra Vox**, a slightly awkward but enthusiastic history buff who wants to be an "ally" to the new clans. In reality, she is **Seraphina Vox**, the youngest daughter of Arch-Duke Cymon Vox, the energy magnate of Harmony.

## Session 2 Appearance
At the Block 99 bonfire, Serra approached [[Britt]] and [[Aggie]] with aggressive curiosity, calling the gathering "the most important anthropological cauldron in years." She claimed to be from the far east side of the main continent (near Settika) but slipped when mentioning she'd spent "unfortunate" time in The Seat due to "political pressure."

When Britt tried to charm her for more info (Failure with Fear), Serra shut down and deflected.

Later, she explained the **Inverse Power Doctrine** to [[Ignatius]]: Harmony grants the newest integrated member the highest voting power to prevent exploitation. *"The least of us should become the most of us."* She revealed that [[Lady Ignis]] holds the most political power in Harmony because of this rule.

She also noted that every discovered place has a "purpose" except the [[Mizizi]] forest, which puzzles scholars. She took frantic notes when Ignatius explained Ash-Blood physiology (heat release via burning hotter, not sweating).

Key slip-ups in Session 2:
- Admitted to spending time in The Seat under "political pressure"
- Knew detailed political doctrine (unusual for a small-town girl)
- Called it "unfortunate" that she'd been to the capital

## Personality
- **Public Persona (Serra Vox):** Eager, nervous, and fascinated by the Clans (almost to the point of fetishization). She asks slightly inappropriate questions but means well.
- **True Self (Seraphina Vox):** A highly skilled Bard with an "airy, ethereal" voice. She is chasing the "Primal Song" of a Shattered Node to prove herself. She hides her identity to avoid the pressure of her father's name.

## Motivations
- **The Primal Song:** She believes the Clans hold the key to a lost magic (the "Drivers") that can restore the Primal Song.
- **Rebellion:** Hiding as "Serra Vox" is her way of rebelling against the rigid expectations of House Vox.

## Relationships
- **[[Valerius Sterling]]:** Her squad captain. He knows her secret and protects it, but finds her fascination with the "Uncalibrated" clans dangerous.
- **[[Ignatius]]:** Skeptical of her "ally" persona ("I don't trust this b*tch").
- **[[Cassius Thorne]]:** He has a crush on her; she seems oblivious.
- **[[Britt]]/[[Aggie]]:** Genuinely fascinated by them but made them uncomfortable with too many questions.
