# Rill

**Role:** Mizizi Researcher / "Traitor" / Futurist
**Affiliation:** Harmony (Publicly Mizizi, Secretly Wadi)
**Status:** Active
**Archetype:** The Futurist

## Overview
Rill is a researcher at Vumbua Academy who is publicly known as a **Mizizi** traitor who left the Forest two years ago. **Secretly, she is a Wadi (River Clan)** member who has integrated so perfectly that she passes as Mizizi. She arrived at the Academy **2 months ago** after spending time in the "Silent Zones" between leaving the forest and joining Harmony.

## Timeline
*   **2 Years Ago:** Left the Mizizi Forest (The "Traitor" event).
*   **2 Months Ago:** Arrived at Vumbua Academy as a researcher.

## Personality
- **Intelligent, Determined:** She loves the forest, but knows the Elders' "Stagnation" doctrine is suicide.
- **Goal:** Joined Harmony to find a cure for the "Eternal Growth" cancer/data corruption affecting the Mizizi.
- **Connection:** Knows Britt and Aggie (possibly) from her time in the forest, though they may not know her true Wadi nature.
- **The Secret:** Her Wadi heritage gives her a different perspective on "Flow" and "Stagnation" than a true Mizizi, allowing her to solve problems they cannot.
