# Ember

**Role:** Ash-Blood Student
**Affiliation:** Ash-Blood, Vumbua Academy
**Status:** Active (mentioned but not yet appeared on-screen)

## Overview
Ember is an Ash-Blood student and Ignatius's childhood cousin. She represents the **modernizer** faction among the Ash-Bloods---those who embrace Harmony's technology and prefer "clean" crystal battery energy over traditional organic fire.

## The Cultural Divide
Ember is excited to use Harmony's batteries and refuses to touch organic fire ever again. This puts her in direct opposition to traditionalists like Ignatius, who views her stance as disrespectful to Ash-Blood heritage.

Serra Vox mentioned Ember during the Session 2 bonfire conversation about Ash-Blood cultural tensions.

## Personality
- Enthusiastic about Harmony's "clean" energy
- Rejects traditional fire-tending as outdated
- Represents the younger Ash-Blood generation that sees integration as liberation, not compromise

## Relationships
- **Ignatius:** Childhood cousin. He considers her rejection of fire disrespectful to their heritage.
- **Lady Ignis:** Likely aligned with Ignis's pragmatic pro-integration stance.
