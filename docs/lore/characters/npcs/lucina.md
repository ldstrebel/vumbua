# Lucina

**Role:** Maintenance Worker, Power Room
**Race:** Dwarf
**Affiliation:** Vumbua Academy (staff)
**Status:** Active

## Overview

Lucina is a dwarf maintenance worker doing routine upkeep in the power room. She chose maintenance over the explorer track deliberately.

## Philosophy

"Why go through the effort to travel when you can get it for free by working?"

Lucina sees no appeal in the danger and uncertainty of exploration. She's content with steady work, reliable pay, and not getting eaten by Ether-Beasts. She views the explorer candidates with a mix of bemusement and pity.

## Session Appearances
