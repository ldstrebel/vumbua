# Cassius Thorne

**Role:** Student (Gold Rank)
**Affiliation:** Harmony (Thorne Family), Vumbua Academy
**Status:** Active

## Overview
Cassius Thorne is the son of **Captain Elara Thorne**, the exploranaut who discovered the Ash-Blood Isles. He's a nervous, bookish student who hides behind textbook knowledge and perfectionism. Despite his Gold rank and famous family name, he'd rather study thermal distribution than live up to the Thorne legacy.

## Session 2 Appearance
At the Block 99 bonfire, Cassius was obsessively arranging logs for "optimal thermal distribution" when Ignatius lit the fire prematurely. He panicked (*"The thermal distribution was---this is very non-optimal!"*) but was charmed by Lomi's critical-success encouragement.

He has a visible crush on Serra Vox---glancing at her for approval, cheeks turning rosy when she's nearby. He admitted: *"I wasn't planning to come here tonight. But I felt like this was the place to be."*

## Personality
- Nervous, bookish, and detail-oriented
- Follows the textbook rigidly---quotes the manual on everything
- Genuinely kind underneath the anxiety
- Desperate to earn something on his own, not ride the Thorne name

## Relationships
- **Captain Elara Thorne:** His mother. He finds the family name burdensome.
- **Serra Vox:** He has a crush on her and tries to impress her with academic knowledge.
- **Lomi:** Responded well to Lomi's encouragement at the bonfire.
- **Silas Thorne:** Possible distant relation (older Thorne branch).
