# Seraphina "Serra" Vox

*The Runaway Scion of House Vox*

## Overview
Known to most students as **Serra Vox**, a slightly awkward but enthusiastic history buff who wants to be an "ally" to the new clans. In reality, she is **Seraphina Vox**, the youngest daughter of Arch-Duke Cymon Vox, the energy magnate of Harmony.

## Appearance
* **As "Serra"**: Wears standard-issue mechanic's coveralls (too big for her), smudged with grease to look like a "worker". Messy hair, constant scribbling in a notebook.
* **True Form**: High-born features, skin likely glowing faintly from high-quality diet/energy exposure (which she tries to hide with soot).

## Personality
* **Public**: Over-eager, apologetic, tries too hard to use slang. "Is that the right word? I'm an ally!"
* **Private**: Incredibly sharp education in politics and history. She knows *exactly* how the city runs because her father owns the batteries.

## Motivation
* **The Rebellion**: She hates her father's "Energy Monopoly" and the way House Vox exploits the clans.
* **The Goal**: She wants to prove that **Cooperation** is more efficient than **Exploitation**. She's looking for a team that can change the world, not just explore it.

## Secrets [GM ONLY]
* **The Bounty**: There is likely a quiet "Retrieve Only" bounty on her head from her father.
* **The Knowledge**: She knows the **Energy Consumption Rates** are fake. She knows the city is dying faster than anyone admits.
* **The family**: She is the only one who knows that her brother, **Caelus**, didn't die in an accident—he was "re-purposed" for questioning the Great Stitching.
