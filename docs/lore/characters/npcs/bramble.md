# Bramble

**Role:** Squad 05 (The Harvesters) - Member
**Race:** Plant-kin
**Affiliation:** Vumbua Academy, Mizizi (Plant-Kin?)
**Status:** Active

## Overview
Bramble is a thoughtful, philosophical plant-person. Nobody is entirely sure what Bramble is---plant-person? Harmony botanist who got weird? Mizizi-adjacent? Member of Squad 05, The Harvesters.

## Session 2 Appearance
At the Block 99 bonfire, Bramble participated in the Speculators' Debate. While Percy argued for missing clans and Jax dismissed the idea, Bramble offered the most provocative perspective:

*"What if they are not the missing? What if we are the ones who forgot?"*

## Personality
- Thoughtful and slow-speaking---not mystical, just deliberate
- Offers philosophical perspectives that reframe the debate
- The "what if we forgot" line suggests awareness of deep history
