# Percival "Percy" Vane-Smythe III

> "Mark my words! When we find the missing clans, I'll be vindicated!"

**Role:** Squad 08 (The Legacy) - Captain (Gold Rank)
**Affiliation:** [[Vumbua Academy]], [[Vane Lineage|House Vane]] (Harmony)
**Origin:** Shepta (southern desert city)
**Status:** Active

## Overview
Percy is a well-dressed, genuinely curious theorist---not the entitled noble his appearance suggests. He's passionate about the **Sixfold Theory** (the fringe academic belief that six clans must exist to complete an elemental symmetry) and would rather study obscure journals than attend galas. A distant nephew of the Dean.

## Session 2 Appearance
At the Block 99 bonfire, Percy was holding court about the Sixfold Theory, arguing passionately with [[Iron-Jaw Jax]], [[Bramble]], and [[Zephyr]].

*"I'll wager 50 sovereigns that there's an Earth clan underground! We've got Plants, Fire... there MUST be an Earth clan to complete the symmetry!"*

When [[Lomi]] mentioned hearing noises in the boiler room, Percy was delighted: *"See! Salt of the earth! The boiler workers know!"* He introduced himself as Percy Vane-Smythe III and immediately bonded with Lomi.

Percy led the group to [[Lucky]] to buy "Engine Grease" (moonshine), showing he knows the campus hustler network. He paid in sovereigns.

## Personality
- Genuinely curious and reads obscure academic journals
- Views Vumbua as "the greatest library in the world"
- Wants to be an academic, not a military captain (against [[Vane Lineage|House Vane]] tradition)
- Believes Harmony's mission is noble: "preserving knowledge and preventing another Dark Age"
- Well-connected socially (knows [[Lucky]], navigates both bonfire and fancy party scenes)

## The Sixfold Theory
Percy's core belief: the known clans (Plants/[[Mizizi]], Fire/[[Ash-Bloods]]) are only part of a larger pattern. He theorizes Earth, Air, Water, and possibly more clans exist undiscovered.

## Relationships
- **[[Lomi]]:** Bonded quickly over shared curiosity. Respects him as "salt of the earth."
- **[[Lucky]]:** His supplier for contraband. Existing business relationship.
- **[[Iron-Jaw Jax]]:** Ongoing debate partner (Jax thinks the theory is nonsense).
- **[[Britt]]/[[Aggie]]:** Fascinated by them as potential evidence for his theories.
