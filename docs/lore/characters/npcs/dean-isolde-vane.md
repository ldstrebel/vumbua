# Dean Isolde Vane

> "We are not building a school. We are building a lifeboat."
> — *Dean Vane*

**Role:** Headmaster of Vumbua Academy
**Affiliation:** Vumbua Academy, Vane Family (Harmony)
**Status:** Active
**Archetype:** The Desperate Architect

## Overview
Dean Isolde Vane is the stern, visionary leader of Vumbua Academy. While often perceived as a sinister administrator or a puppet of Harmony, her true motivation is desperation. She is frantic to solve the "Integration Equation" before the "Lights" (the Venture's power) die out completely.

## Personality
- **Public Persona:** Cold, calculating, and authoritative. She speaks in architectural and engineering metaphors.
- **Hidden Depth:** She genuinely loves the Clans, viewing them as lost family or essential components of a broken machine. Her "cruelty" is triage; she hides the true extent of the power crisis to prevent panic.

## Motivation
- **The Shattered Empire Theory:** She believes the Clans are specialized castes of the original builders (Mizizi = Memory, Ash-Blood = Power, Trench-Kin = Stability).
- **Goal:** To "install" the Clans back into the Venture's systems (the "Integration Equation"). She needs "Drivers"—cultural keys to make these incompatible systems work together.

## Relationships
- **Valerius Sterling:** Tolerates him, but views his "Variance" theory as limited.
- **The Party:** Has high hopes for them as potential "Drivers" or catalysts for integration.
