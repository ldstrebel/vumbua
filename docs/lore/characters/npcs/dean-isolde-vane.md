# Dean Isolde Vane

> *"Hello students! Hello candidates! Hello potential adventurers! I'm just so excited for this next class."*

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Origin** | Vane Lineage (House Vane) |
| **Rank** | Dean of Vumbua Academy |
| **Affiliation** | Vumbua Academy, Vane Lineage |
| **First Appearance** | Session 1 |

## GM Description

A small, energetic figure---comparable to a female Professor Heimerdinger from *Arcane*. She bounces onto stage rather than walking, paces frantically during speeches, and radiates chaotic enthusiasm. Her size is notable; she is dwarfed by the podium and the massive auditorium she addresses. Despite leading the largest mobile city in Harmony, she presents as scattered and approachable rather than authoritative.

## Personality

- **Enthusiastic to the point of chaos:** Paces frantically, speaks in rapid bursts, forgets to introduce herself
- **Genuinely excited about discovery:** Her love of exploration comes across as authentic, not performative
- **Scattered but sharp:** Forgot to say her own name during the welcome speech, popped back out from the curtain to add it as an afterthought
- **Lonely in her role:** Admitted openly that 80 years of stagnation left her lonely---"Not to say my thousand weren't great, but more is better!"
- **Blunt about stakes:** Casually dropped that 20,000 students would be cut by week's end, without sugarcoating it

## Background

Dean of [[Vumbua Academy]] and member of the [[Vane Lineage]] ([[Vane Lineage|House Vane]]), which historically controls defense and walls. She has led the Academy through the 80-year Silent Era of no new discoveries and championed the relocation to the Ash-Blood Isles 6 months ago.

## Session Appearances

### Session 1
- Bounced onto stage in the Great Hall to welcome the 100,000-strong intake class
- Gave an enthusiastic, scattered speech about the end of the 80-year silence and the excitement of new discoveries
- Praised the [[Ash-Bloods]] for "mastery of heat" and the [[Mizizi]], admitting "we don't really know what they do, and that's amazing!"
- Casually announced 20,000 more students would be cut by end of the week
- Forgot to introduce herself, then popped back out from behind the curtain: "Oh! I'm Dean. I'm Dean Isolde! If you need me... well, I'm kind of busy."
- [[Rill]] (the Dean's assistant) leaned out, pulled her back behind the curtain with a familiar, comfortable dynamic
- [[Britt]]'s immediate reaction: "I don't trust this f***ing guy." (mistaking her gender or just expressing suspicion)

### Session 2
- Not present on screen. [[Serra Vox]] identified Rill as the person who pulled the Dean off stage.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Rill** | Assistant and trusted confidante; pulled her off stage during the welcome speech; familiar, comfortable dynamic |
| **Zephyr** | Zephyr works with Dean Vane on wind-pattern research in late-night Sky-Spire sessions |
| **Lord Commander Titus Vane** | Family connection through the Vane Lineage; wants aggressive tactics vs. Dean's empathy |

## GM Narration [NOT YET REVEALED TO PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information has been narrated by the GM but is not known to the player characters.

### The Desperate Truth

Dean Isolde knows the power is failing. The scattered, bubbly persona masks a leader carrying an existential secret: if this intake class doesn't find a strong Node, the lights at the Academy---and back home---will go out forever. Vumbua cannot travel back if they fail; there isn't enough power to move the Cores.

### The Shattered Circuit

Dean Vane has confirmed a terrifying mathematical reality alongside Historian Nadine: the Ash-Blood and [[Mizizi]] Nodes are Major in size but outputting only Minor Node power because they are reaching out to their missing siblings. She knows about the Shattered Circuit theory---all six clans must be integrated.

### The "Great Cull" Strategy

The massive intake class (largest in history) was her decision. The philosophy: expect 95% attrition during the Trials and another 20% loss during Intern Voyages. Stop training "Glory Seekers" and start manufacturing "Survivalists."

### Political Tension

Lord Commander Titus Vane ([[Vane Lineage]]) wants aggressive expansion tactics. Dean Isolde favors empathy and integration through cultural connection. This tension within her own family lineage is an ongoing pressure.

### The Loom

The Loom calculates "Savant" flags based on variance---high-variance outliers who solve problems using unsanctioned methods. Dean Isolde understands and uses this system, but its full implications are a closely guarded secret.

### Lore Dump vs. Session Canon

The original planning document depicted Dean Isolde differently---in a "crisp, high-collared white uniform" delivering a polished, controlled speech gripping the podium so hard the brass creaked. In actual session play, she was instead portrayed as small, bouncy, scattered, and genuinely enthusiastic. Session canon takes precedence.
