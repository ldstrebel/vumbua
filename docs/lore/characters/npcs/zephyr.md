# Zephyr

> "That one was pretty good."
> --- *Zephyr*, after being struck by her own purple lightning bolt.

**Aliases:** Lightning Girl (Ignatius's nickname)
**Role:** Unknown---managed by Rill/the Dean
**Race:** Unknown (Storm-Kin? [[Renali]]?)
**Affiliation:** [[Vumbua Academy]], [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Vane]]'s inner circle
**Status:** Active

## Overview
Zephyr is a chaotic, fun-loving girl with platinum hair who doesn't understand why everyone at the Academy is so serious. She can summon massive purple lightning bolts---possibly involuntarily---and is being closely managed by [[Rill]] on behalf of the Dean.

## Session 2 Appearance
At the Block 99 bonfire, Zephyr was part of the Speculators' Debate where she dismissed pattern-seeking: *"Or maybe the world is just broken. Not everything needs to be a pattern."*

When [[Lomi]] brought Engine Grease (moonshine), Zephyr grabbed a jar immediately. On her second attempt to spit it into the fire, she turned purple, her hair stood up with static electricity, and she simultaneously spit grease into the fire AND summoned a **massive purple lightning bolt** from the clear sky that struck her. She was completely unharmed.

[[Rill]] appeared immediately and dragged her away, bribing her with hot chocolate. [[Ignatius]] yelled to ask her name. Rill called back: *"Her name is Zephyr, [[Ignatius|Lava Boy]]."*

## Personality
- Chaotic and impulsive---does things because they seem fun
- Doesn't understand social conventions or seriousness
- Loves drinking, storms, and hot chocolate
- Bored by the Dean's questioning sessions
- Free-spirited, possibly aloof or difficult to pin down

## Abilities
- Can cause purple lightning---triggered when she drank Engine Grease and tried to spit it into fire
- Completely unharmed by her own lightning
- Static electricity builds visibly in her hair before discharge
- The lightning came from a clear sky (not natural weather)

## GM Secrets
- Zephyr is a **[[Renali]] (Storm-Kin/[[Renali|Cloud-Kin]])** exchange member who arrived 18 months ago among the [[Mizizi]]
- Unlike disciplined envoys, she openly breaks the Exchange Taboo
- She speaks freely of High-Jet Streams and the Thunder-Node
- She works with [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Vane]] on wind-pattern research (late night sessions in Sky-Spire)
- [[Dean Isolde Vane|The Dean]] believes she's key to understanding high-altitude flight
- Her lightning ability is likely connected to the Renali's Air Node

## Relationships
- **[[Rill]]:** Manages her on behalf of the Dean. Can bribe her with hot chocolate.
- **[[Ignatius]]:** Called him "[[Ignatius|Lava Boy]]"; he called her "Lightning Girl." Mutual nicknames established.
- **[[Dean Isolde Vane|The Dean]]:** Zephyr finds the questioning sessions boring but likes the Dean personally.
