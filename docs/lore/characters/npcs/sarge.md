# Sarge

**Role:** Squad 09 (The Ablative) - Captain (Rust Tier)
**Affiliation:** Vumbua Academy, "The Engine Room"
**Status:** Active
**Archetype:** The Safety Inspector

## Overview
"Sarge" is a Rust-tier veteran, likely an older student or a TA/Worker who keeps getting pulled into squads to keep them alive. He works in the boiler rooms with Lomi---they know each other from the workers' campfire social hours.

## Session 1 Appearance
Sarge recognized Lomi coming out of the exams: *"Loaves? Loaves, we made it. Can you believe it?"* He admitted he barely passed (*"I just looked at the typewriter. Seems about right."*) and was overwhelmed but doing it "for the lads."

## Session 2 Appearance
At the Block 99 bonfire, Sarge was leaning against a wall watching Lucky sell Engine Grease, kicking empty bottles disapprovingly.

## Personality
- **Not Bitter, Protective:** He isn't bitter about his station; he's protective. He warns Ignatius about his fire because he's seen unchecked energy kill good people.
- **Goal:** Wants his squad to survive the physics of the world, avoiding the politics.
- Disapproves of Lucky's hustling but doesn't intervene directly
