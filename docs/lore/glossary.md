# Glossary

## A

**Aether / The Ether**
- The chaotic space between integrated realities
- Filled with dangerous beasts and unstable physics
- Becomes calm "Safe Lanes" after successful integration

**Ash-Bloods** (The Ember-Kin, Pyre-Keepers)
- Volcanic clan with obsidian skin and fire affinity
- Successfully integrated 24 months ago
- Primary name: **Ash-Bloods**

## B

**The Bleed** (Dissolution)
- The edge of the map where reality pixelates and fades
- Caused by lack of expansion or failed integration
- The fate of the "Dissolved Lands"

## C

**Chime Spires** (Resonators)
- Musical, organ-like structures built by House Gilded during Era 1
- Synchronize raw ether into usable power (like antennas tuning into a broadcast)
- The original power infrastructure of Harmony
- No surge protection---caused the Night of Sparks when overloaded

**Crystal Batteries** (Vox Batteries)
- Built by House Vox using umber crystals from Umbra Mountain
- NOT traditional batteries---they regulate the connection to the ether field, like wireless chargers
- Two innovations: surge protection (caps power intake) and stored connection (allows operation away from nodes)
- Current generation: **Panda line** (550 amps, car-battery sized, lasts ~1 year)
- Scrapped next generation: **Apex 1** (designed for a post-Ash-Blood surge that never came)
- Currently running lean (secret)

**Copper** (Aes)
- Third-tier rank - 55% of students
- Laborers and general workforce

## E

**Ether-Jelly**
- Phase-shifting jellyfish creatures
- Actually memories of Dissolved lands
- Attracted to strong emotions
- DO NOT shock them (causes psychic explosion)

**Exchange Ritual**
- Inter-clan genetic diversity system
- Occurs every 5 years at neutral "Hollow Point"
- Members blindfolded to prevent mapping
- Taboo: Never speak of your home again
- Last ritual was 18 months ago

**Exploranaut**
- Professional explorer employed by Harmony
- Once meant adventurer, became academic title during Silent Era
- Now returning to original meaning

## G

**Global Amplitude** [GM ONLY]
- Total ether energy available across Harmony's integrated territory
- Not stored energy---a living field that rises as nodes are integrated
- Has small natural surges and oscillations ("breathes like a living thing")
- Historical: ~350 (400 years ago) → ~450+ (post-Night of Sparks) → ~600 (Era 4 peak) → ~600 declining (present)
- The Ash-Blood integration should have added +300 to +800 but only added ~20

**Gold** (Aurum)
- Highest rank - 1% of students
- Aristocracy, cannot be demoted to Rust
- Britt and Iggy tested Gold

**The Great Stitching**
- The process of integrating separate realities
- Physically pulls continents together via resonance
- "We do not conquer land; we wake it up"

## H

**Harmony** (The New Empire)

- Philosophy: "Expansion is life"
- Capital: Harmony Prime (distant)

**Harmony Prime**
- The static capital city far from the frontier
- Seat of the Domestic Council
- Where Lady Ignis serves on High Council

## I

**Integration**
- The process of connecting a new Node to Harmony
- Requires two-way energy flow (Inward + Outward)
- Creates Safe Lanes and amplifies both realities

**Inward Flow**
- Raw materials from new Node power Harmony tech
- Must be at 100% efficiency
- Example: Ash-Blood obsidian in boilers

**Outward Flow**
- Harmony batteries power local functions in new territory
- Proves Harmony sustains the new land
- Example: Cooling suits for Ash-Bloods

## L

**The Loom**
- Massive crystal computer in the Walker-Core
- Calculates probabilities and assigns ranks
- Can flag "Savant" outliers based on variance

## M

> [!CAUTION]
> **GM ONLY:** "The Minimum" - Power threshold below which Harmony tech fails

**The Minimum** [GM ONLY]
- Critical power level Harmony is approaching
- When crossed, lights and medical devices lose charge
- State secret known only to Council and Dean
- Discussing it is taboo even among those who suspect

**Mizizi** (Root-Kin, Deep-Root Clan, Mycelium Clan)
- Fungal-turtle hybrid clan from Petrified Forest
- Actually archivists of ancient Empire (unknown to players)
- Philosophy: "When things stop dying, we start dying"
- Integration stalled at 15%
- Primary name: **Mizizi**

**Night of Sparks** [GM ONLY]
- ~400 years ago, a major node integration caused a 30% surge in Global Amplitude (from ~350)
- Without surge protection, every Gilded resonator in Harmony overloaded
- Massive fires; nearly destroyed House Gilded
- Led to House Vox developing the first Crystal Batteries
- House Gilded pivoted from energy production to banking

## N

**Node**
- Pocket of concentrated reality/power
- Each represents specific physics (Heat, Growth, Water, etc.)
- Weak when isolated, powerful when integrated
- Major vs. minor determined by degree of sentient transformation, not raw power alone

## O

**Obsidian Tablet**
- Message Ash-Bloods sent to Trench-Kin instead of Exchange bride
- "The Heat has returned. We need nothing from the Dark"
- Found by Iggy, led him to surface

**Outward Flow**

**Shattered Circuit** [GM ONLY]
- Theory that 6 clans were one ancient Empire
