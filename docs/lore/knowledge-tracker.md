# Knowledge Tracker

> **Purpose:** Track what players know vs. GM secrets still hidden

## The Mizizi Forest

### What Players Know
- ✅ The forest is petrified/stone
- ✅ Harmony is helping them destroy it with solvents and tools
- ✅ The Mizizi philosophy: "When things stop dying, we start dying"
- ✅ Rill left the forest 2 years ago to research at Vumbua

### GM Secrets (Players Don't Know)
- ❌ The forest is a **data archive/library**
- ❌ The trees are biological hard drives storing Imperial history
- ❌ Destroying it erases thousands of years of knowledge
- ❌ The "new growth" represents hardy archive fragments
- ❌ Integration requires Mizizi bark to be turned into paper filled with knowledge

## The Power Crisis

### What Players Know
- ✅ Vumbua has "flickering lights" occasionally (might not have noticed)
- ✅ The Academy relocated recently to the Ash-Blood Isles

### GM Secrets (Players Don't Know)
- ❌ "The Minimum" crisis exists
- ❌ Harmony is running out of power
- ❌ The Global Amplitude has been declining for 80 years (first decline in recorded history)
- ❌ The Panda line batteries (550 amps) are approaching failure threshold
- ❌ The Ash-Blood integration only produced ~20 amp increase instead of expected +300 to +800
- ❌ House Vox scrapped the Apex 1 battery line
- ❌ Professor Kante is investigating the Ash-Blood Anomaly
- ❌ The Night of Sparks (~400 years ago) nearly destroyed House Gilded
- ❌ House Gilded built the original resonators; House Vox built the crystal batteries
- ❌ Crystal batteries are not storage---they regulate the ether connection
- ❌ This is why the massive intake happened
- ❌ If they fail, the lights go out forever
- ❌ Even discussing power levels is taboo

## Iggy's Origin

### What Players Know
- ✅ Iggy is "Earthkin"
- ✅ He came up from the docks/water
- ✅ He's extremely curious and inventive

### GM Secrets (Players Don't Know)

- ❌ The Trench-Kin are completely uncontacted by Harmony
- ❌ He's an infiltrator investigating the surface
- ❌ The Ash-Bloods rejected the Exchange ritual (insulting the Trench-Kin)
- ❌ He found the obsidian tablet and came to learn why

## Integration Mechanics

### What Players Know
- ✅ Harmony "integrates" clans somehow
- ✅ The Ash-Bloods are successfully integrated (volcanoes roaring)
- ✅ The Mizizi integration is "incomplete" or "stalled"

### GM Secrets (Players Don't Know)
- ❌ Integration requires **two-way energy flow** (Inward + Outward)
- ❌ The "Shattered Circuit" theory - all six clans must be integrated
- ❌ Each individual integration only buys 1-2 years of power
- ❌ Completing the circuit = 500-year Golden Age
- ❌ The "Safe Lane" phenomenon (calm corridors through Aether storms)

---

## The Clans

### What Players Know
- ✅ Mizizi live in petrified forest, fungal-turtle people
- ✅ Ash-Bloods are volcanic forge-keepers with obsidian skin
- ✅ The Exchange Ritual exists (genetic diversity system)
- ✅ Zephyr is a Storm-Kin who breaks the taboo openly

### GM Secrets (Players Don't Know)
- ❌ The clans are **specialized castes** of one ancient civilization
- ❌ The "Shattered Empire" fell 10,000 years ago
- ❌ There are exactly six clans needed:
  - Mizizi (Memory)
  - Ash-Bloods (Power)
  - Trench-Kin (Resources)
  - Renali/Storm-Kin (Vision)
  - Wadi (Life)
  - Plus Harmony (Direction)
- ❌ Separation caused the Shattering, not proximity

---

### What Players Know

- ❌ The Loom calculates "Savant" flags based on variance
- ❌ Lord Commander Titus Vane wants aggressive tactics vs. Dean's empathy
