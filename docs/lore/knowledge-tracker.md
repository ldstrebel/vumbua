# Knowledge Tracker

> **Purpose:** Track what players know vs. GM secrets still hidden

## The Mizizi Forest

### What Players Know
- ✅ The forest is petrified/stone
- ✅ Harmony is helping them destroy it with solvents and tools
- ✅ The Mizizi philosophy: "When things stop dying, we start dying"
- ✅ Rill left the forest 2 years ago to research at Vumbua
- ✅ The forest doesn't have a clear "purpose" like other nodes---this puzzles Harmony scholars (Session 2)
- ✅ There's a problem: "too much life"---things aren't dying properly (Session 2)
- ✅ Mizizi view death as natural and celebrate the cycle; Harmony culture fears death (Session 2)
- ✅ The Mizizi have NOT been formally integrated---no seat at Harmony, just a "semi-short-term weapons trade" (Session 2)

### GM Secrets (Players Don't Know)
- ❌ The forest is a **data archive/library**
- ❌ The trees are biological hard drives storing Imperial history
- ❌ Destroying it erases thousands of years of knowledge
- ❌ The "new growth" represents hardy archive fragments
- ❌ Integration requires Mizizi bark to be turned into paper filled with knowledge

## The Power Crisis

### What Players Know

- ❌ "The Minimum" crisis exists
- ❌ Harmony is running out of power
- ❌ The Global Amplitude has been declining for 80 years (first decline in recorded history)

- ❌ The Ash-Blood integration only produced ~20 amp increase instead of expected +300 to +800
- ❌ House Vox scrapped the Apex 1 battery line
- ❌ Professor Kante is investigating the Ash-Blood Anomaly
- ❌ The Night of Sparks (~400 years ago) nearly destroyed House Gilded
- ❌ House Gilded built the original resonators; House Vox built the crystal batteries
- ❌ Crystal batteries are not storage---they regulate the ether connection
- ❌ This is why the massive intake happened
- ❌ If they fail, the lights go out forever
- ❌ Even discussing power levels is taboo
