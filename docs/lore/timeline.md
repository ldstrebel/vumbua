# Campaign Timeline

## Ancient History

### 3,000 Years Ago - Era 1: The First Spark
- The Weavers and Navigators meet on a dying shard
- First "Stitch" creates Harmony Prime
- House Gilded builds the first **Chime Spires**---musical resonators that synchronize raw ether into usable power
- For the first 30-50 years, Tesla-like spires on buildings harness ether directly into lights and devices

### 2,500 - 1,500 Years Ago - Era 2: Resource Wars
- Harmony's aggressive expansion causes "Dissolved Lands"
- Vane Lineage rises to power building defensive walls
- Lesson learned: "One-way flow leads to Dissolution"

### 1,500 - 1,000 Years Ago - Era 3: The Golden Stitch
- Scrivener Guild decodes Symbiotic Resonance laws
- Golden Age of integration - massive continent growth
- Vumbua Academy built as first "Teleporting City"

### ~400 Years Ago - The Night of Sparks
- A major node is integrated, causing the Global Amplitude to surge from ~350 by over 100 (a 30% increase)
- Without surge protection, the spike overloads every Gilded resonator in Harmony
- Massive fires erupt across the empire; nearly ruins House Gilded
- **Aftermath:** House Vox develops the first Crystal Batteries using umber crystals from Umbra Mountain
- Vox batteries solve two problems: surge protection (capping power intake) and consistent output
- House Gilded pivots from energy production to banking

### 1,000 - 80 Years Ago - Era 4: The Dwindling
- Great Nodes all integrated, only Minor Nodes remain
- Comfortable stagnation sets in
- Exploranauts become historians instead of adventurers
- Global Amplitude gradually rises as nodes accumulate, reaching ~600

---

## The Silent Era (80 Years Ago - Present)

### 80 Years Ago
- **The Drought Begins:** No new Nodes discovered
- Ocean of Aether becomes impassable
- Council sees power reserves dwindling
- "The Minimum" crisis begins (state secret)
- Global Amplitude plateaus at ~600 and begins declining for the first time in recorded history

### 50 Years Ago
- The "Bleached Atoll" incident (island crumbled to dust)
- Proves stagnation leads to destruction

### ~20 Years Ago
- House Vox releases the **Panda line** batteries---current generation
- First battery line capable of storing the connection to the land inside the crystal matrix
- Allows operation up to **3 days outside a node's range** (previous batteries required node proximity)
- Panda line batteries set at 550 amps (below the ~600 Global Amplitude max), car-battery sized, last ~1 year
- This breakthrough enables exploration beyond Harmony's current bounds

### 24 Months Ago - **BREAKTHROUGH**
- **Valerius Sterling Sr.** discovers the Mizizi one week before Thorne finds the Ash-Bloods
- Sterling Sr. ("The Paper Man") arrives at the Petrified Forest but moves on---integration work bores him
- **Captain Elara Thorne** discovers the Ash-Blood Isles
- Ash-Bloods accept Cooling Suits (Outward Flow)
- Harmony burns Obsidian (Inward Flow)
- **Integration successful** - volcanoes roar to life
- Safe Lane opens through the Aether storm
- **Anomaly:** Ash-Blood integration produces only ~20 amp increase to Global Amplitude---barely better than a minor node discovered 80 years ago, despite being classified as a major node (expected +300 to +800)

### 18 Months Ago
- **Last Exchange Ritual** occurs
- **Zephyr** (Storm-Kin) arrives among Mizizi
  - Unlike disciplined envoys, she openly breaks the Taboo
  - Speaks freely of High-Jet Streams and Thunder-Node
- Ash-Bloods **fail to send bride** to Trench-Kin
  - Drop obsidian tablet: "The Heat has returned. We need nothing from the Dark"
  - Insults the deep dwellers

### 12 Months Ago
- Vumbua begins preparing for relocation
- Largest recruitment drive in history announced
- Previous intake class travels with the Academy ships

### 6 Months Ago
- **Vumbua Academy relocates** to Ash-Blood Isles
- Worker-Constructs swarm out to build Spire-Scape
- Temporary city erected using spare labs and buildings
- Iron-Union retrofits boiler room for Obsidian direct-transfer
- Ash-Blood youth beg for boiler room shifts (feels like home)

### 4 Months Ago
- Mizizi integration attempts begin
- Harmony brings fertilizer/solvents to "help destroy forest"
- **Integration stalls** - something is wrong
- Dean Isolde and Historian Nadine begin researching the blockage

### 2 Months Ago
- **Rill arrives at Vumbua Academy**
  - **Secretly Wadi (River Clan):** Originally entered Mizizi Forest as an exchange member **6 years ago**.
  - **2 Years Ago:** Left Mizizi forest claiming to study "Accelerated Decay" (The "Traitor" event).
  - **Now:** Actually researching if forest needs to be destroyed at all.
  - Sends letters welcoming other Mizizi to join her.
- Zephyr joins Dean Vane's inner circle
  - Late night sessions in Sky-Spire sketching wind-patterns
  - Dean believes she's key to high-altitude flight
