# Vumbua Academy (The Mobile City)

> *"We do not conquer land; we wake it up."*

**Aesthetic:** 1920s Oxford meets *Treasure Planet*. Brass, teal energy, stone masonry, and modular construction.

## What Players Know

Vumbua is the massive mobile academy-city where the campaign takes place. It recently teleported to the Ash-Blood Isles after 80 years of stagnation. Over 100,000 candidates arrived for the intake. The city is under construction, with cranes and worker-constructs constantly assembling new districts.

### The 30/70 Rule

**The Cores (30%):** The only permanent, moving structures. They teleport/fly to new frontiers and act as the anchors.

| Core | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **The Sky-Spire** | Command, Elite Dorms, Navigation | A vertical, golden airship towering above the city |
| **The Deep-Hull** | Classrooms, Logistics, Mess Halls | A massive iron steamship forming the city's base |
| **The Walker-Core** | Engineering, Power, The Loom | A four-legged industrial power unit on the grounds' edge |

**The Spire-Scape (70%):** Upon landing, thousands of "Worker-Constructs" swarm out to assemble a temporary city around the Cores. A forest of scaffolding, steam cranes lifting prefab dorms, and ley-lines laid directly into the dirt. It feels like a high-tech refugee camp mixed with a World's Fair.

### Key Locations

| Location | Description |
|---|---|
| **Block 04** | Mizizi dorms. Modular units built into a terraced cliff. Looks like a repurposed green room. |
| **Block 12** | Standard dorms. Classic Academy housing. Iggy and Ignatius's room. |
| **Block 99** | Copper/Worker dorms. A geothermal plant with steam stacks. Lomi's assignment. Site of the bonfire. |
| **Greek Row** | Posh social clubs for Gold-tier students. |
| **The Clan Assistance Office** | Where clan students get support navigating Harmony bureaucracy. |
| **The Great Library** | Massive archive. Contains the "Bleached Atoll" report. |
| **The Industrial Zone** | Where cranes drop construction materials. Iggy climbed a crane here. |
| **The Bonfire Pit** | Outside Block 99. Where Serra Vox invited the party for Session 2. |

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!CAUTION]
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### Magic & Technology

**Geometric (Harmony) Magic:** Rigid, formulaic, "Safe." Uses tuning forks, crystals, and math. Teal, steady, geometric shapes. Quiet hums.

**Variance (Wild) Magic:** The magic of the Clans. Raw, emotional, unpredictable. Orange/Green/Brown, flickering, organic shapes. Crackling or singing sounds.

### The Loom

A massive crystal computer in the Walker-Core. It calculates probabilities and assigns ranks. It can identify "High-Variance" outliers (the Savant Loophole) who solve problems using unsanctioned methods.

### The Receipt System

The *only* official proof of status. A narrow strip of parchment printed by 1920s-style typewriters. Without a receipt, you are a non-entity. Resource currency is "Charge" or "Battery Hours"---gold is decorative; energy is survival.

### The Desperate Truth

Vumbua teleported for the first time in a century because a deep-scan revealed two faint pulses---the Ash-Bloods (Heat) and the Mizizi (Memory). If this expedition fails, the Academy cannot travel back. They are stranded.
