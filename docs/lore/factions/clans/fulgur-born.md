# The Fulgur-Born (Storm-Chasers)

> *"To stop moving is to lose your charge. Stasis is death."*

## What Players Know

The Fulgur-Born are treated as a rumor or singular anomaly. Most Academy students have never heard of them. [[Zephyr]]---the energetic exchange member at the Academy---is assumed by most to be [[Renali]] ([[Renali|Air Clan]]), not a representative of an entirely separate storm-based civilization.

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### The Element & The Node

| | |
|---|---|
| **Element** | Plasma (Lightning) |
| **Node** | The Judgment Seat |
| **Rarity** | Volatile / Fleeting |
| **Biome** | Solidified lightning clouds in the jet stream |
| **Integration Status** | Unknown |

Pure, unshielded energy discharge. The Judgment Seat is too dangerous to use for steady power, but it can kick-start a dead engine or overcharge a weapon in an emergency---the ultimate "Jump Start."

### The Crisis: "The Silence"

The storm is quieting. Lightning strikes are becoming infrequent. Without the strikes, the Fulgur-Born's energy-based biology is starving. They are constantly vibrating or pacing because stasis means death.

### The Ancestral Taboo: "The Grounding"

You never stand still. To stop moving is to lose your charge. The Fulgur-Born are constantly vibrating, pacing, twitching. Stasis is death. Being "grounded" (literally and figuratively) is the worst fate imaginable.

### First Contact Story: "The Slow Walker"

> A "Slow-Walker" (Vanguard Runner) entered the Glass Desert. He moved clumsily, dragging a metal sled. He had no charge---he was dim. We skated to him to share the Spark, to "Judge" him. But he screamed and fired a weapon that threw a net. He fled before we could bless him with voltage. We learned that the Slow Ones fear the blessing.

### The Exchange Exception

The Fulgur-Born are the only clan exempt from the Exchange Ritual's blindfold requirement. They must move constantly to stay alive within the jet streams. Though they keep no physical maps, they cannot help but learn the land from above, witnessing the ruins of the empire they left behind.

This makes them the most dangerous---and knowledgeable---of all the clans. They have seen things no one else has.

### Zephyr

[[Zephyr]] arrived in the last Exchange (18 months ago), entering the [[Mizizi]] Forest. Unlike the disciplined envoys of the past, the Storm-Kin are naturally wild and fearless.

She breaks the Great Taboo not out of malice, but out of sheer, uncontainable excitement. She doesn't fear "The Shattering." She speaks openly of the "High-Jet Streams" and the "Thunder-Node."

[[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Vane]] has personally invited Zephyr into the inner circle. They can be found late at night in the Sky-Spire, eating sunflower seeds and frantically sketching wind-patterns on a chalkboard. Vane believes Zephyr holds the key to high-altitude flight.

### Integration Potential

- **Inward Flow:** Infinite electrical power (but volatile)
- **Outward Flow:** Weather control technology
- **The Value:** The "Jump Start"---emergency power that could save the system during a Minimum crisis

### The Shattered Circuit Role

In the Shattered Circuit theory, the Fulgur-Born represent **Storm**---the catalyst energy that activates the other elements. They may be the final piece needed to trigger the Great Surge.
