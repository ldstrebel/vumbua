# The Wadi (River Clan)

> *"A cup of water in the desert is worth more than a ton of gold."*

## What Players Know

The Wadi are known to exist but are scarce. Their home Node is fading, so few travel to the Academy. Players know that Rill---the researcher who left the Mizizi Forest two years ago---exists at the Academy, but they do not know she is secretly Wadi.

The Exchange Ritual historically connected the Wadi to the Trench-Kin through underwater shafts, maintaining genetic diversity between the water-aligned clans.

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!CAUTION]
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### The Element & The Node

| | |
|---|---|
| **Element** | Fresh Water (Hydrology) |
| **Node** | The Aquifer Stone |
| **Rarity** | Scarce / Critical |
| **Biome** | The "Dry Vein" (Desert Canyon) |
| **Integration Status** | Unknown (Declining) |

The solvent of life. Water binds biological matter. Everyone needs it to live, giving the Wadi immense leverage despite their weak, trickling Node.

### The Crisis: "The Thirst"

The aquifers are empty. The Wadi lost their bond with the Air Clan (Renali) long ago---the Renali once provided air bubbles that allowed the Wadi to live inside their river walls. When the Old Empire fell, the Renali retreated, the bubbles stopped, and the river dried up. The survivors were forced onto the canyon floor.

Now they are dust-cacti people waiting for rain that never comes. They sacrifice their own rainwater to feed the Node rather than drink it themselves.

### The Lost Bond

The Wadi were once inextricably linked to the Renali (Air Clan). They lived *inside* the river walls, breathing via air bubbles provided by the Renali. The collapse of this symbiosis is one of the great tragedies of the Shattered Circuit.

### Natural Adaptation

The Wadi have evolved to retain water like cacti. They wear "Still-Suits" made of organic leather to reclaim moisture. They carry "Gems" that hold the residual environmental energy of their lost home.

### The Ancestral Taboo: "The Dry Grave"

> A Water-Scout once fell asleep in a grove of the Root-Kin (Mizizi). The fungi did not attack him; they simply **drank**. He woke up as a desiccated husk, his moisture stolen to feed the rot. Never sleep near the green-bloods; they are always thirsty.

### First Contact Story: "The Stolen Water"

> Strangers in metal suits walked into the Sacred Canyon. They carried canteens of sweet water but did not offer it. We thought they were mocking us. We took their moisture to survive. Then the "Paper-Man" (The Scrivener) came. He did not bring a weapon; he brought a contract. We signed it because he promised the water would flow again.

### View of the Academy: "The Iron Geyser"

The Wadi view the steam pipes and decorative fountains as both a miracle and a sin. They are at the Academy to steal the secret of "Making Water" to save their canyon.

### Rill's Secret

Rill is the only known Wadi at Vumbua Academy. She entered the Mizizi Forest via the Exchange Ritual 6 years ago and integrated so perfectly that she passes as Mizizi. Her Wadi heritage gives her a different perspective on "Flow" and "Stagnation" than a true Mizizi---this perspective may be the key to unlocking the Mizizi integration.

### The Shattered Circuit Role

In Dean Vane's theory, the Wadi represent **Water**---the binding solvent that connects biological systems. Their reconnection with the Renali (Air) is essential to closing the full circuit.
