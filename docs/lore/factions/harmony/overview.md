# Harmony (The Direction)

*The Ruling Coalition of the Shattered Circuit*

## Overview
Harmony is not a single bloodline but a coalition of **Great Houses** and **Guilds** that separated from the ancient empire to preserve "Direction" and "Structure". They believe that without their guidance, the other clans would drift into chaos or stagnation.

They define themselves by **Expansion, Technology, and Law**.

## The Great Houses (The Families)

These families hold seats on the **High Council** and effectively run the civilization.

### House Vane (The Shield)
* **Domain**: Defense, Walls, Military Strategy.
* **Philosophy**: "Safety through Separation."
* **Key Members**:
    *   **Lord Commander Titus Vane**: Leader of the military, believes in aggressive expansion.
    *   **Dean Isolde Vane**: Head of Vumbua Academy, Titus's sister. Believes in understanding over conquest (the "Black sheep").

### House Vox (The Spark)
* **Domain**: Energy, Fuel, Crystal Batteries.
* **Philosophy**: "Power is Life."
* **Key Members**:
    *   **Arch-Duke Cymon Vox**: The ruthless patriarch who controls the battery supply.
    *   **Seraphina "Serra" Vox**: His runaway daughter, hiding at the Academy as "Serra Vox".

### House Sterling (The Sail)
* **Domain**: Trade, Logistics, Fleet Command.
* **Philosophy**: "Movement is Wealth."
* **Key Members**:
    *   **Captain Elara Thorne-Sterling**: Famous explorer, discovered the Ash-Blood Isles.
    *   **Valerius Sterling**: Head of the Merchant Fleet.

### House Gilded (The Vault)
* **Domain**: Treasury, Banking, Resource Allocation.
* **Philosophy**: "Everything has a Price."
* **Notes**: Often in conflict with House Vox over resource pricing.

## The Guilds (The Labor)

While Houses lead, Guilds do the work. The most powerful is:

### The Iron-Union
* **Domain**: Engines, Boilers, Construction.
* **Members**: Engineers, Mechanics, Laborers (like Loami's family).
* **Relationship**: Tension with the Houses. They feel they keep the city running while Houses take the credit.

## Note on "Harmony" as a Clan
To the other clans (Mizizi, Ash-Bloods, etc.), **Harmony** is viewed as a single monolithic block. They don't distinguish between a Vane and a Vox. To an Ash-Blood, they are all "The Cold Ones" or "The Metal-Men".
