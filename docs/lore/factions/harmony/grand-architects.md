## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!CAUTION]
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### Agenda in Vumbua

They hate the "Modular City" aesthetic of Vumbua. They want to pave the Ash-Blood Isles and build a static stone fortress. They are trying to evict the Mizizi from their "unsafe" cliffside dorms (Block 04).

### Conflict Lines

- Despise the Iron-Union's "temporary" metal machines
- Want to replace Vumbua's modular construction with permanent stone
- Their efforts to "condemn" Block 04 directly threaten Britt and Aggie's housing

### Key Agent

**Architect Stone.** A dwarf with geomantic granite hands who is trying to condemn Block 04-Root. He views the Mizizi's organic architecture as structurally unsound and culturally backwards.
