## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!CAUTION]
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### The "Minimum" Motive

The Scriveners are the keepers of the "Dark Ages" Secret. They know the Empire collapsed once before due to isolation. They are terrified that the Mizizi are burning the archives because the Mizizi trees contain the *only* record of exactly *how* the previous collapse happened. If those records are lost, Harmony is doomed to repeat history blind.

### The Shattered Empire Theory

**Lead Researchers:** Dean Isolde Vane & Senior Historian Nadine.

The theory: The Clans are not separate species. They are specialized castes of a single global civilization that shattered 10,000 years ago:
- Mizizi = The Archivists (Memory)
- Ash-Bloods = The Engines (Power)
- Trench-Kin = The Miners (Resources)
- Cloud-Kin/Fulgur = The Architects (Vision)
- Harmony = The Navigators (Direction)

The "Disaster" the clans fear wasn't caused by proximity---it was caused by **separation**. The machine broke, and the parts drifted away. The Great Stitching isn't a new empire conquering them; it is a Repair Mission.
