## What Players Know

House Gilded is the aristocratic elite of Harmony. They perfected the storage of raw magic via Crystal Batteries, allowing civilization to exist at night. Their students wear polished uniforms and carry themselves with an air of entitlement. Valerius Sterling is the most visible Gilded student at the Academy.

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!CAUTION]
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### The "Minimum" Motive

The Crystal Banks are insolvent. They need the "Great Surge" (500 years of power) not just to keep the lights on, but to hide the fact that they leveraged the empire's future on bad energy bets during the Silent Era. House Gilded isn't just wealthy---they're hiding bankruptcy.

### Valerius Sterling Sr.

During the Silent Era, he led suicide missions into the blind mist alongside Captain Elara Thorne. But while Thorne was motivated by the existential threat she saw in the Council data, Sterling Sr. cared only about the massive bounties offered for exploration. His son carries the same opportunism.
