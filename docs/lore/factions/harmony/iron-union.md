## What Players Know

The Iron-Union is the blue-collar nobility of Harmony. They build and maintain the engines that keep the city alive. [[Lomi]] comes from a long line of Union boiler workers---his family hangs schematics of the original boilers on the wall rather than art. The Union is the backbone of Vumbua's physical infrastructure.

## Key NPCs

- **[[Lomi]] (PC)** - The prodigy mechanic. Older than the average student. "Union Strong."
- **"Old Man" Silas** - Captain. The cynical veteran who knows where the bodies are buried. Collects Pre-Stitch artifacts.
- **"Hammer"** - Squad 05 Leader. The ambitious climber.
- **Iron-Hide** - Captain. A living legend among the Union. Started as a Copper-rank boiler scrubber (just like Lomi). Famously held a cracked thermal vent shut with his geomantic skin for 6 hours. Wrote "The Percussive Maintenance Guide (Vol. 4)"---the only textbook Lomi actually likes.

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### The "Minimum" Motive

The Iron-Union are the only faction who physically feel the "Ghost Charge"---power fluctuations that shouldn't exist. They are pushing hardest for Ash-Blood Integration because the Obsidian direct-transfer is the only thing keeping the boilers from exploding. They know the crisis is real because they can *feel it in the engines*.

### Lomi's Position

[[Lomi]] works in the boiler room, making him physically closest to Harmony's deepest secret: the power is failing. He attributes flickering lights and engine stalls to mechanical maintenance issues, but the truth is far worse. The boilers aren't just low on fuel---the containment seals are cracking.

### The Ash-Blood Partnership

Rather than using generic "Potential Energy" cores, the Union has retrofitted the entire port engine to run on Direct Obsidian Transfer. It is 300% more efficient, and the [[Ash-Bloods]] take immense pride in being the literal heartbeat of the city.
