## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!CAUTION]
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### The Crisis

The topsoil in Harmony Prime is dead. The Empire is **6 months away from famine**.

### Agenda in Vumbua

They want to seize the Mizizi Forest. They don't care about the "Memory Node" or the history---they see millions of tons of fertile compost. They are lobbying to **mulch the entire forest** immediately to send fertilizer back home.

### Conflict Lines

- Natural enemies of the **Mizizi** (who view the forest as sacred)
- Natural enemies of the **Scrivener Guild** (who want to save the trees as historical archives)
- Natural allies of **Harmony students** desperate for real food instead of synthetic sludge

### Key Agent

**Overseer Grimaldi.** A massive man in a green velvet suit offering huge bounties for "Life-Soil." He will approach students directly with cash offers to smuggle forest samples.
