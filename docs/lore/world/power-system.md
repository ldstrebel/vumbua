# The Power System

How Harmony keeps the lights on---and why they're flickering.

## What Players Know

Harmony runs on ether---a pervasive energy field that flows through integrated land. The more territory Harmony integrates, the stronger this field becomes. Crystal batteries power everything from streetlights to medical devices, and the currency of daily life is measured in "Charge" or "Battery Hours."

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!CAUTION]
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### The Global Amplitude

The **Global Amplitude** is the total ether energy available across all of Harmony's integrated territory. It is not stored---it is a living, breathing field that rises and falls like a slow heartbeat.

**Key Properties:**
- Each time a new node is integrated into Harmony, the Global Amplitude increases
- Major nodes cause large jumps; minor nodes cause small bumps
- The amplitude has small natural surges and oscillations---it breathes like a living thing
- The Global Amplitude has been measured and documented for most of Harmony's recorded history

**Historical Values:**
- **~400 years ago:** ~350 amps (before Night of Sparks)
- **~400 years ago (post-surge):** ~450+ amps (after major node integration)
- **Era 4 (gradual rise):** Climbed to ~600 as minor nodes accumulated
- **Last 80 years (The Silent Era):** Plateaued at ~600, then began declining for the first time in recorded history
- **Today:** Resonance max ~600, but trending downward

### The Resonators (House Gilded)

The original power infrastructure, built by House Gilded during Era 1.

**How They Work:**
- **Chime Spires** are musical, almost organ-like structures mounted on buildings
- They synchronize with the ambient ether field, converting it into usable power
- Think of them as antennas that tune into a broadcast signal, not generators
- The ether power is always available---the resonators simply tap into it

**Limitation:**
- No surge protection. Whatever the Global Amplitude is, that's what flows through
- When a major node integrated ~400 years ago and the amplitude jumped 30%, every resonator in Harmony overloaded simultaneously
- This was the **Night of Sparks**---massive fires, infrastructure destruction, and the near-ruin of House Gilded

### The Vox Crystal Batteries (House Vox)

Developed after the Night of Sparks using **umber crystals** mined from **Umbra Mountain** (House Vox's home base).

**Important Misconception:** These are not batteries in the traditional sense. They do not store energy. They are more like **wireless chargers** or **regulated antennas** that control the connection to the ether field.

**Innovation #1: Surge Protection**
- The umber crystal matrix caps the amount of power accepted from the ether
- Think of it as a Wi-Fi signal limiter---the power is always available, but the crystal restricts how much flows through
- This prevents the overloading that caused the Night of Sparks
- Current Panda line batteries are set at **550 amps** (safely below the ~600 Global Amplitude max)

**Innovation #2: Stored Connection**
- The crystals can store the **connection to the land** inside their matrix
- Previously, you had to be within proximity of a node to get any power from resonators
- With a Vox crystal battery, the resonator is "convinced" it's still part of Harmony's land, even when it's not
- This is a stored **connection**, not stored **energy**---an important distinction most scientists get wrong

**The Panda Line (Current Generation):**
- Allows operation up to **3 days outside any node's range**
- Duration varies based on Global Amplitude and surrounding conditions (predicting exactly when it cuts out is an art)
- When the stored connection expires, power drops to **absolute zero**---no gradual decline
- About car-battery sized; each lasts ~1 year before the surge protection degrades and output becomes inconsistent
- Set at 550 amps

**The Apex 1 (Scrapped Next Generation):**
- Designed in anticipation of the Ash-Blood integration surge
- Projections estimated the Global Amplitude would jump from 600 to 900, 1100, or even 1400 (a major node should add +300 to +800)
- The Apex 1 was built with surge protection rated above those projected lines
- **Now scrapped:** The Ash-Blood integration only produced a ~20 amp increase, making the Apex 1's specifications irrelevant
- All marketing and rollout plans are moot

### The Ash-Blood Anomaly

This is the central mystery that Professor Kante is investigating:

**Expected:** A major node integration (like the Ash-Bloods) should produce a massive Global Amplitude increase (+300 to +800 amps), similar to the surge that caused the Night of Sparks ~400 years ago.

**Actual:** The Ash-Blood integration produced only a ~20 amp increase---barely better than a minor node discovered 80 years ago.

**Implications:**
1. Why did a major node produce minor node results?
2. If the Global Amplitude drops below the Panda line's 550 amp setting, the batteries can no longer provide consistent output
3. If the amplitude drops further below storage thresholds, the ether field's natural breathing/surging will cause power output to become erratic and unpredictable
4. The Shattered Circuit theory may explain the leak---the Ash-Blood node is "reaching out" to its missing siblings, bleeding energy into the void

### The Ticking Clock

If the Global Amplitude continues to decline:
- **Above 550:** Business as usual (current Panda line works)
- **At 550:** Batteries begin inconsistent output as natural amplitude surges dip below the cap
- **Below 550:** Systematic power failures begin
- **Well below 550:** The Minimum---lights go out, medical devices fail, Harmony's infrastructure collapses
