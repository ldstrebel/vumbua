# The Bleed (Dissolution)

The edge of the map where the land turns into pixelated static and grey mist.

## Harmony View: "Dimensional Instability"

A lack of geometric scaffolding. The land is simply "falling off" the map. Harmony engineers treat it as a structural problem to be solved with anchors and walls.

## What Players Know

The Bleed exists at the edges of claimed territory. It is dangerous and unstable. Students are warned to stay well within mapped boundaries during field exercises.

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!CAUTION]
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### Clan View: "The Great Forgetting"

The world is a dream. When the dreamer wakes up, the edges fade.

### The Truth

The Bleed is what happens when the Great Stitching fails. If civilization stops expanding, the reality of claimed lands begins to dissolve. This has happened before, creating the "Dissolved Lands"---entire continents that shattered because the energy flow was one-way (extraction only).

### The Precedent: The Bleached Atoll

In the Great Library, there exists a report titled *"The Bleached Atoll."* It details a small island found 50 years ago that had completely stagnated. When Harmony tried to integrate it, the island simply crumbled into dust. It was too far gone. This is the fate Dean Vane fears for the Mizizi and Ash-Blood territories if they don't act fast.

### Connection to The Minimum

As Harmony's power reserves dwindle, the Bleed creeps inward. The edges of Harmony's territory are already fraying. The Vane Lineage (Defenders) built walls to hold it back, but walls only slow the inevitable without new Stitches to stabilize reality.
