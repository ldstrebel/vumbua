# The Minimum (Energy Crisis)

The flickering of the magitek lights; the groaning of the engines.

## Harmony View (Public): "Temporary Efficiency Cycle"

Official propaganda: "We are re-routing power to the new expansion. It is a sign of growth!"

## What Players Know

The lights flicker sometimes. Block 99 (Copper dorms) lost power for 4 hours one night. Official reason: "Upgrades." Lomi, who works in the boiler room, may sense something deeper is wrong with the engines.

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!CAUTION]
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### The Truth

Harmony is running out of power. The "Silent Era" (80 years without finding new Nodes) has drained the Crystal Batteries. The Dean claims the new expansion is for "Glory" and "Destiny," but the real reason is existential survival.

**If the Venture fails, the Academy cannot travel back.** They will be stranded without enough power to move Vumbua's cores.

### The Numbers

- **House Gilded** is hiding insolvency---the Crystal Banks are empty
- **The Iron-Union** physically feels the "Ghost Charge"---power fluctuations that shouldn't exist
- **The Vane Lineage** knows the perimeter walls are failing
- **The Scrivener Guild** knows the Empire collapsed once before due to isolation

### Clan Perspective: "Too Much Connection"

The City eats more than it bleeds. It is a parasite looking for a new host.

**Lomi's Insider Knowledge:** The boilers aren't just low on fuel; the *containment seals* are cracking. The city is trying to eat itself to stay alive.

### The Block 99 Incident

The lights in the Copper Dorms (Block 99) went out for 4 hours last night. Official reason: "Upgrades." Real reason: The Sky-Spire needed the power for a dinner party.

### The Shattered Circuit Leak

Dean Vane has confirmed a terrifying mathematical reality: the Ash-Blood and Mizizi Nodes are "Major" in size but outputting only Minor Node power. Because these Nodes were once part of a unified Empire, they are metaphysically "reaching out" to their missing siblings (Trench, Cloud, etc.). Energy is bleeding into the void.

### The Ticking Clock

- Integrating a single clan buys Harmony **1-2 years** of power at most
- The only real fix is integrating **all six** Shattered Clans
- Completing the set would trigger a **500-Year Golden Age**
- Even that is temporary---entropy is inevitable
