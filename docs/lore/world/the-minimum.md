# The Minimum (Energy Crisis)

The flickering of the magitek lights; the groaning of the engines.

## Harmony View (Public): "Temporary Efficiency Cycle"

Official propaganda: "We are re-routing power to the new expansion. It is a sign of growth!"

## What Players Know

The lights flicker sometimes. Block 99 (Copper dorms) lost power for 4 hours one night. Official reason: "Upgrades." [[Lomi]], who works in the boiler room, may sense something deeper is wrong with the engines.

## GM Secrets [HIDDEN FROM PLAYERS]

> [!warning]-
> The following information is not known to the player characters.

### The Truth

Harmony is running out of power. The "Silent Era" (80 years without finding new Nodes) has caused the [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] to plateau and begin declining for the first time in recorded history. The Crystal Batteries (Vox Panda line, set at 550 amps) are approaching the point where the Global Amplitude's natural oscillations will overwhelm their surge protection, causing erratic power output. [[Dean Isolde Vane|The Dean]] claims the new expansion is for "Glory" and "Destiny," but the real reason is existential survival.

See [[The Power System]] for full technical details on Global Amplitude, Resonators, and Crystal Batteries.

**If the Venture fails, the Academy cannot travel back.** They will be stranded without enough power to move Vumbua's cores.

### The Numbers

- **Global Amplitude:** ~600 amps and declining (first decline in recorded history)
- **Panda line threshold:** 550 amps (below this, power becomes erratic)
- **Ash-Blood integration:** Should have added +300 to +800 amps, only added ~20
- **[[House Gilded]]** is hiding insolvency---the Crystal Banks are empty
- **The [[Iron-Union]]** physically feels the "Ghost Charge"---power fluctuations that shouldn't exist
- **The [[Vane Lineage]]** knows the perimeter walls are failing
- **The [[Scrivener Guild]]** knows the Empire collapsed once before due to isolation
- **House Vox** scrapped the Apex 1 battery line (designed for a post-Ash-Blood surge that never came)

### Clan Perspective: "Too Much Connection"

The City eats more than it bleeds. It is a parasite looking for a new host.

**[[Lomi]]'s Insider Knowledge:** The boilers aren't just low on fuel; the *containment seals* are cracking. The city is trying to eat itself to stay alive.

### The Block 99 Incident

The lights in the Copper Dorms (Block 99) went out for 4 hours last night. Official reason: "Upgrades." Real reason: The Sky-Spire needed the power for a dinner party.

### The Shattered Circuit Leak

[[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Vane]] has confirmed a terrifying mathematical reality: the Ash-Blood and [[Mizizi]] Nodes are "Major" in size but outputting only Minor Node power. Because these Nodes were once part of a unified Empire, they are metaphysically "reaching out" to their missing siblings (Trench, Cloud, etc.). Energy is bleeding into the void.

[[Professor Kante]]'s whiteboard independently confirms this: his projections show the Ash-Blood integration should have produced a Global Amplitude increase of +300 to +800, but only ~20 materialized---barely better than a minor node discovered 80 years ago.

### The Ticking Clock

- Integrating a single clan buys Harmony **1-2 years** of power at most
- The only real fix is integrating **all six** Shattered Clans
- Completing the set would trigger a **500-Year Golden Age**
- Even that is temporary---entropy is inevitable
