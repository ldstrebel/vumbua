## Academy Leadership

### Dean Isolde Vane

**Quote:** *"We are not building a school. We are building a lifeboat."*

**Role:** Headmaster of Vumbua Academy  
**Affiliation:** Vane Family (House of Defense), Vumbua Academy  
**Archetype:** The Desperate Architect

**Appearance:** Stern, authoritative presence. Speaks from floating podiums with commanding voice.

**Personality:**
- **Public Persona:** Cold, calculating, authoritative. Speaks in architectural and engineering metaphors.
- **Hidden Depth:** Genuinely loves the Clans, viewing them as lost family or essential machine components. Her "cruelty" is triage—hiding true extent of power crisis to prevent panic.

**Motivation:**
- Believes in "Shattered Empire Theory"—Clans are specialized castes of original builders
- Goal: Integrate Clans back into Venture's systems (the "Integration Equation")
- Needs "Drivers"—cultural keys to make incompatible systems work together
- Frantically racing against "The Minimum" power crisis

**Relationships:**
- Sister to Lord Commander Titus Vane (military hardliner)
- Works with Rill and Senior Historian Nadine on integration research
- Has high hopes for the party as potential "Drivers"

**Plot Hooks:**
- Knows about Shattered Circuit theory
- Aware of approaching power crisis
- May recruit party for special missions
- Balances empathy with pragmatism

> [!CAUTION]
> **GM SECRET**: Dean Isolde knows that without successful integration of all six clans, Harmony will collapse within 2 years. The massive intake class is a desperate gamble to find enough Exploranauts to solve the Integration Equation before the lights go out forever.

---

### Celia Vance

**Role:** Academy Administrator  
**Affiliation:** Vumbua Academy staff

**Appearance:** Professional, clipboard-wielding, always checking on student welfare.

**Encounters:** Makes rounds at bonfires and gatherings, writing notes, intervening when things get too rowdy.

**Plot Hooks:** Source of information about Academy rules, schedules, and official policies.

---

## Legacy Students (The Elite)

### Seraphina "Serra" Vox

**Quote:** *"I'm an ally. Is that okay to say?"*

**Aliases:** Serra Vox (public), Seraphina Vox (true identity)  
 **Role:** Squad 01 (The Echelon) - Bard, Gold Rank  
**Affiliation:** House Vox (hidden), Vumbua Academy

**Appearance:** Enthusiastic, slightly awkward history buff. "Airy, ethereal" voice when singing.

**Personality:**
- **Public Persona ("Serra"):** Eager, nervous, fascinated by Clans (almost to point of fetishization). Asks slightly inappropriate questions but means well.
- **True Self (Seraphina):** Highly skilled Bard chasing the "Primal Song" of a Shattered Node. Rebelling against father's rigid expectations.

**Motivation:**
- Believes Clans hold key to lost magic (the "Drivers") that can restore Primal Song
- Hiding identity to experience Academy authentically, without father's name
- Genuinely wants to be "ally" but from privileged position of ignorance

**Relationships:**
- Daughter of Arch-Duke Cymon Vox (ruthless energy magnate)
- Valerius Sterling knows her secret and protects it
- Approached the party in Session 1 as potential "ally"
- Cassius Thorne is desperately smitten with her

**Current Status:** Interviewing clan members at bonfires, taking copious notes.

**Day-to-day:** Asks invasive questions (genuinely thinks she's being respectful), takes excessive notes, donates to clan scholarship funds anonymously.

> [!CAUTION]
> **GM SECRET**: Serra is runaway daughter of one of Harmony's most powerful men. If her identity is revealed, it could attract unwanted attention to the party—or provide access to incredible resources.

**Role:** Legacy Student (Vane family distant relation)

**Appearance:** Pampered Harmony noble in Clean-Suit, enthusiastic with chalkboard.

**Personality:** Academic enthusiast obsessed with fringe theories. Most students think he's ridiculous, but he's genuinely passionate.

**Current Activity:** Holds court at bonfires about "Sixfold Theory"—there must be six clans (Fire, Water, Plant, Metal, Earth, Lightning) to complete the symmetry.

**Key Quotes:**
