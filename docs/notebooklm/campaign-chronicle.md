## Player Characters

### Britt (Mizizi, Gold Rank)

**Player:** Sophie  
**Quote:** *"When things stop dying, we start dying."*

**Appearance:** Gray fungal-turtle hybrid with moss and shell—sturdy and earthy, distinctly Mizizi.

**Personality:** Sure-footed and observant. Protective of Aggie, quick to think on feet, willing to bend rules when necessary. More aggressive in questioning Harmony's motives than her cousin.

**Background:** Born in the Petrified Forest of the Mizizi homeland. Selected to attend Vumbua Academy when Harmony made contact. Views the relationship with suspicion—the elders made deals with "the paperman" to destroy the forest, which goes against traditional Mizizi understanding.

**Key Moments:**
- Held down test flag to wait for Aggie to finish (Session 0)
- Received Gold rank—one of only 1% of students
- Outspoken about Harmony relationship to fellow Mizizi

**Motivations:**
- Understand Harmony's true motives
- Find answers about why the forest failed
- Protect Aggie and their people

---

### Aggie (Mizizi, Silver Rank)

**Player:** Christina  
**Quote:** *"When things stop dying, we start dying."*

**Appearance:** Red-and-white spotted mushroom-turtle—another Mizizi with characteristic spore-textured skin.

**Personality:** Cautious but curious. More reserved than Britt, diplomatic rather than confrontational. Shares concerns privately through gossip rather than open questioning. Trying not to "piss anyone off" while staying alert.

**Background:** Grew up alongside Britt in the Petrified Forest. Selected for Vumbua Academy together—they view it as fate. Less aggressive in approach but equally concerned about the forest's failure to decay.

**Key Moments:**
- Finished entrance exam just in time after Britt's distraction (Session 0)
- Received Silver rank (24% of students)
- Shares gossip with Britt about Harmony

**Motivations:**
- Support Britt while avoiding direct conflict
- Observantly gather information
- Help their clan survive the stalled cycle

---

### Ignatius (Ash-Blood, Silver Rank)

**Player:** John  
**Quote:** *"Why did all the elders leave?"*

**Appearance:** Covered in soot with literal flames—obsidian skin glowing with inner heat, leaving ash trails wherever he goes.

**Personality:** Facade of confidence that melts when confronted with Harmony's overwhelming scale. Idealistic about Ash-Blood independence, viewing integration as partnership not subservience. "Classic teenager with strong political ideals who doesn't really know how the world works."

**Background:** From the Ember Isles (Ash-Blood homeland). Witnessed the Integration ceremony where Lady Ignis rose to sudden prominence and the volcano came alive. On a "pilgrimage" to find new heat for his clan—though he doesn't yet understand that integration itself IS the answer.

**Key Moments:**
- Overwhelmed by scale of Vumbua on arrival (first fear roll of campaign)
- Met Lance (Bridgerton-esque chad) who recognized him as Ash-Blood
- Received Silver rank
- Questions why all the elders left with Lady Ignis

**Motivations:**
- Find "new heat" for his clan (misunderstands that integration provides this)
- Ensure Ash-Bloods aren't being exploited
- Prove the relationship is partnership, not conquest

---

### Lomi (Harmony Native, Copper Rank)

**Player:** TBD  
**Quote:** *"They paying you well here?"*

**Appearance:** Harmony native—humanoid, cosmopolitan, fitting into established civilization.

**Personality:** Practical and worker-conscious. Union-minded ("family born and raised boiler boiler mega union"). First instinct meeting overwhelmed exam attendants was to check their working conditions. Down-to-earth despite extraordinary circumstances.

**Background:** Harmony native from Octoumba continent (where previous Vumbua was stationed). Familiar with Harmony culture but still finds new academy overwhelming. Family has deep ties to boiler worker community and Iron-Union.

**Key Moments:**
- Chatted with attendant about working conditions (Session 0)
- Received Copper rank (55% of students)
- Offered job hint by attendant ("It's always good to know your options")

**Motivations:**
- Achieve Explorer rank (like becoming "NFL star"—instant celebrity)
- Represent worker interests
- Navigate as a Copper in a system favoring higher ranks

---

### Iggy (Trench-Kin Infiltrator, Gold Rank)

**Player:** Holly  
**Quote:** *"Where am I?"*

**Appearance:** Slimy physiology producing mucus. Unusual enough that attendants recoiled and required supervisor escort.

**Personality:** Bewildered, curious, unconventional. Navigates with child-like wonder that causes chaos. Physically unusual and seemingly clueless about basic civilization concepts.

**Background [GM SECRET]:** Actually Trench-Kin—completely uncontacted deep-earth/ocean clan. Found the insulting Obsidian Tablet dropped by Ash-Bloods instead of Exchange bride. Came to surface to investigate why they "need nothing from the Dark."

**Key Moments:**
- Used receipt printer as tissue, destroying cubicle functionality (Session 0)
- Asked "Where am I?" to overwhelmed attendant
- Supervisor escorted him through personally
- Received Gold rank (flagged as unusual by The Loom)

**Motivations:**
- Understand surface world and Harmony
- Learn why Ash-Bloods rejected Trench-Kin
- Investigate "the Light" mentioned on tablet

**GM Note:** Other players don't know Iggy's true origin. His confusion is genuine—he's from an entirely different society.

## Session Recaps

### Session 0: The Trials

**Date:** Campaign Start  
**Location:** Vumbua Academy Intake Grounds

#### The Largest Intake Ever

100,000 candidates arrived at Vumbua Academy for entrance trials—the largest class in the Academy's thousand-year history. The mobile city had just relocated to the Ash-Blood Isles after 80 years of stagnation, and the discovery of new frontiers created unprecedented demand for Exploranauts.

#### The Testing

Students took entrance exams in brass cubicles connected to **The Loom**—a massive crystal computer that calculates probabilities and assigns ranks based on performance and variance.

**Key Moments:**
- Britt held down her flag, stalling to wait for Aggie to finish
- Lomi checked on working conditions of overwhelmed attendants
- Iggy destroyed a cubicle by using the receipt printer as a tissue
- Ignatius was recognized by Lance, a posh Harmony native

#### The Culling

By day's end, 30,000 candidates had already been sent home. The Academy expects another 20,000 to leave after "Intro Voyages." Temporary facilities (the Spire-Scape) were built for 100,000, but proper housing only exists for ~20,000.

#### Rank Assignments

**The Loom** assigned ranks:
- **Gold** (1%): Britt, Iggy - Cannot be demoted to Rust
- **Silver** (24%): Aggie, Ignatius - Professional workforce
- **Copper** (55%): Lomi - Laborers and general workforce
- **Rust** (20%): Many sent home immediately

#### Dean's Welcome

**Dean Isolde Vane** welcomed the class from a floating podium in the Great Hall:
- Acknowledged the historic nature of this intake
- Spoke of "waking up the world, not conquering it"
- Hinted at the importance of the Ash-Blood and Mizizi integrations
- Mentioned upcoming "trials of cooperation"

#### The Bonfire (Block 99)

First-years gathered at an informal bonfire in Block 99 (a repurposed geothermal plant). The party formed organically:
- Britt and Aggie found each other (Mizizi cousins)
- Ignatius approached, curious about other clan members
- Lomi joined, offering Harmony-native perspective
- Iggy wandered in, bewildered but curious

**Conversations:**
- Shared concerns about Harmony's motives
- Discussed the forest's failure to decay (Mizizi perspective)
- Questioned the Integration ceremony (Ignatius's experience)
- Learned about Vumbua's structure and history (Lomi's knowledge)

---

### Session 1: First Day

**Date:** Intake Week - Day 2  
**Location:** Vumbua Academy Campus

#### Housing Assignments

Dorm assignments scattered the group across the Spire-Scape:
- **Block 12** (Academic District): Britt, Aggie (Mizizi with other high-rank students)
- **Block 99** (Industrial District): Ignatius, Lomi (near boiler workers)
- **Block 04** (Random Assignment): Iggy (supervisor didn't know where else to put him)

Despite separation, curiosity brought them back together.

#### Iggy Climbs a Crane

Iggy, fascinated by height, climbed a construction crane "to touch the sky." Workers initially panicked, then realized:
- He had natural climbing ability (high-pressure adapted physiology)
- He genuinely didn't understand the danger
- Supervisor sighed: "Just... let him finish. He'll come down."

This incident became campus gossip within hours.

#### Meeting Serra Vox

**Seraphina "Serra" Vox** approached the group, introducing herself as "Serra Vox" (hiding her noble family name). She presented as an eager anthropology student interested in clan cultures.

**What She Asked:**
- About Mizizi forest life and death philosophy
- About Ash-Blood fire and heat regulation
- Whether they felt welcomed by Harmony

**What She Didn't Reveal:**
- She's daughter of Arch-Duke Cymon Vox (House Vox patriarch)
- She's a runaway hiding her identity
- She has access to resources far beyond typical students

Britt was suspicious. Aggie was polite but cautious. Ignatius saw potential ally. Iggy asked if she knew where he was.

#### Learning About Rill

Other Mizizi students mentioned **Rill**—another Mizizi (actually Wadi in disguise) who left the forest 2 years ago. Now a researcher at Vumbua Academy.

**What They Heard:**
- "The Traitor" who abandoned the forest
- Now studies "Accelerated Decay" at the Academy
- Sends letters to Mizizi students welcoming them
- Works in the Fungal Research Labs (Block 12)

Britt and Aggie have mixed feelings—curiosity vs. clan loyalty.

#### Lucky's First Deals

**Lucky**, a street-smart hustler, was already running scams:
- Selling "answers" to tomorrow's Gen-Ed test
- Trading dorm reassignmenttickets
- Offering to "expedite" equipment requisitions

The party observed but didn't engage. Lomi recognized the hustle—seen it in every station he's worked.

#### Tomorrow: First Classes

Schedule announced:
- **8:00 AM - Gen-Ed Exploration 101** (Written Assessment)
- **2:00 PM - Practical Simulations** (Physical Tests)

Students scattered to prepare. Some sought bonfire gatherings for hints. Others crammed textbooks. Iggy asked what "class" meant.

## Knowledge Tracker

> **Purpose:** Track what players know vs. GM secrets still hidden

### The Mizizi Forest

**✅ What Players Know:**
- The forest is petrified/turned to stone
- Harmony is helping destroy it with solvents and tools
- Mizizi philosophy: "When things stop dying, we start dying"
- Rill left the forest 2 years ago to research at Vumbua
- Forest won't decay properly—new growth appears instantly

**❌ GM Secrets (Players Don't Know):**
- Forest is a biological data archive storing 10,000 years of Imperial history
- Trees are biological hard drives containing memories
- Destroying it erases knowledge of the Golden Age
- "Tethering protocol" prevents information overload
- Integration requires feeding the forest *knowledge* (books/archives), not fertilizer
- Pruning Oldest-to-Youngest means deleting most valuable records first

---

### The Power Crisis

**✅ What Players Know:**
- Vumbua has occasional flickering lights (might not have noticed)
- Academy relocated recently to Ash-Blood Isles

**❌ GM Secrets (Players Don't Know):**
- "The Minimum" crisis exists—critical power threshold
- Harmony is running out of power
- Batteries draining for 80 years
- Massive intake happened because they desperately need Exploranauts
- Without new integrations, the lights go out forever
- Each integration buys only 1-2 years
- Discussing power levels is taboo

---

### Iggy's Origin

**✅ What Players Know:**
- Iggy is "Earthkin" (vague identity)
- He came up from the docks/water
- Extremely curious and inventive
- Slimy physiology
- Genuinely confused about surface world

**❌ GM Secrets (Players Don't Know):**
- Iggy is Trench-Kin (deep-earth/ocean clan)

- Ash-Bloods rejected Exchange ritual, insulting Trench-Kin
- He found the Obsidian Tablet: "The Heat has returned. We need nothing from the Dark"
- Came to learn why Ash-Bloods abandoned them

---

### Integration Mechanics

**✅ What Players Know:**
- Harmony "integrates" clans somehow
- Ash-Bloods successfully integrated (volcanoes roaring)
- Mizizi integration "stalled" or "incomplete" (15%)
- Integration brings benefits to both sides
- Creates "Safe Lanes" through dangerous Aether

**❌ GM Secrets (Players Don't Know):**
- Integration requires two-way energy flow (Inward + Outward)
- "Shattered Circuit" theory—all six clans must be integrated
- Each individual integration buys only 1-2 years of power
- Completing circuit = 500-year Golden Age
- Specific Node requirements (e.g., Mizizi Node needs knowledge, not fertilizer)

---

### The Clans

**✅ What Players Know:**
- Mizizi live in petrified forest, fungal-turtle people
- Ash-Bloods are volcanic forge-keepers with obsidian skin
- Exchange Ritual exists (genetic diversity system every 5 years)
- Zephyr is Storm-Kin who breaks the Taboo openly
- There might be other clans (Trench-Kin, Wadi, Renali) based on rumors

**❌ GM Secrets (Players Don't Know):**
- Clans are specialized castes of one ancient civilization
- "Shattered Empire" fell 10,000 years ago
- Exactly six clans needed:
  - Mizizi (Memory) - The Archivists
  - Ash-Bloods (Power) - The Engines
  - Trench-Kin (Resources) - The Miners
  - Renali (Vision) - The Architects
  - Wadi (Life) - The Sustainers
  - Harmony (Direction) - The Navigators
- Separation caused the Shattering, not proximity

---

### Vumbua Academy

**✅ What Players Know:**
- Mobile city with three Cores (Sky-Spire, Deep-Hull, Walker-Core)
- 70% is temporary scaffolding (Spire-Scape)
- 100,000 intake, expecting massive attrition (~20,000 remain)
- Using spare buildings temporarily (Block 99 is geothermal plant)
- First class at this new location
- Academy relocates every 50 years to new frontiers

**❌ GM Secrets (Players Don't Know):**
- Academy CAN'T return home if they fail (not enough power)
- Dean Isolde knows about Shattered Circuit theory
- The Loom flags "Savant" outliers based on variance (Britt and Iggy were flagged)
- Lord Commander Titus Vane wants aggressive tactics vs. Dean's empathy

---

### Character Secrets

**✅ What Players Know:**
- Rill left Mizizi forest 2 years ago (viewed as traitor)
- **Zephyr** (Storm-Kin Exchange Member):
  - Nervous, crackling with static
  - Dismissive: "Maybe the world really IS just broken. Not everything needs to be a conspiracy."
  - Day-to-day: Breaks minor rules constantly (shows up late, sleeps on rooftops, forgets room assignment)
  - GM Note: Zephyr got bored with Dean Isolde's research and snuck out to see what the bonfire was about
- Serra Vox is interested in clan cultures
- **Serra:**
  - Genuinely fascinated by clan cultures
  - CRITICAL: Can be patronizing without realizing ("It's amazing how you've adapted to OUR environment!")
  - Takes excessive notes (might feel like being studied)
  - Day-to-day: Asks invasive questions, genuinely thinks she's being respectful, donates to clan scholarship funds anonymously
- Lady Ignis is important in Harmony government
- **Cassius:**
  - Anxious overachiever trying to impress Serra
  - Memorizes manuals perfectly
  - Mother is Captain Elara Thorne (discovered Ash-Bloods) - huge shoes to fill
  - Day-to-day: Studies until 3 AM, color-codes notes, practices tying knots in sleep, terrified of disappointing famous mother

**❌ GM Secrets (Players Don't Know):**
- **Rill:** Actually Wadi, not Mizizi. Entered forest as exchange member 6 years ago. Researching if forest destruction is necessary.
- **Serra:** Seraphina Vox, runaway daughter of Arch-Duke Cymon Vox. Hiding noble identity to learn authentically.
- **Ignatius:** Genuinely doesn't know integration itself IS the "new heat" he seeks.
- **Lady Ignis:** Under Harmony's "Inverse Power Doctrine," she's one of most powerful people in empire. She *signed* the Expansion Bill authorizing Vumbua's relocation.

---

## Session 2 Planning

### Goals
- **Bonfire Scene:** Socialize, learn lore, get hints for Gen-Ed test
- **First Classes:** "Gen-Ed - Exploration 101" written and practical assessments
- **World Building:** Show scale and diversity of Vumbua (70,000 students)

---

### Establishing Shot: The Academy at Night

The camera pulls back from the bonfire to reveal **seventy thousand students** living across this mechanical leviathan. The Blocks stretch into darkness—industrial furnaces (80-100), academic spires (1-30), residential sprawl (30-80).

**Movement everywhere:** Not walking—*meandering*. Scholars shuffle between libraries. Workers change shifts in synchronized waves. Officers march with purpose. Gondolas ferry students between heights.

**Sound:** Low mechanical hum. Clank of footsteps on metal. Distant "Clank-Step" music from dance halls. Hiss of steam vents. Thousands of voices blending into white noise.

**Harmony's Diversity:** Vast majority are Harmony citizens—humans of every culture, constructs, warforged, integrated species from a hundred territories. Ideology divides them: Clean-Suits (elite) vs. Tech-Wear (workers), Believers vs. Skeptics, Loyalists vs. Rebels.

**The Clan Minority:** Among 70,000, clan members like Ignatius, Britt, and Aggie are vanishingly rare—perhaps a few hundred total. They stand out precisely because they're different in a sea of Harmony conformity.

**The Message:** You are three clan members in a city of seventy thousand Harmony citizens. You could disappear here—or make them all remember your names.

---

### Bonfire Hooks: The Five Encounters

#### Hook #1: The Speculators' Debate
**NPCs:** Percy Vane-Smythe III, Iron-Jaw Jax, Bramble, Zephyr

Percy holds court about "Sixfold Theory"—there must be Earth and Lightning clans to complete the symmetry. Most students roll their eyes (academic fringe theory), but the party might recognize kernels of truth.

**Hint Drop:** Gen-Ed test might ask about Sixfold Theory (trivia question).

**Plot Hooks:**
- Percy might recruit party for expedition
- Bramble might ask Britt/Aggie about "the flow" in forest
- Jax might warn Ignatius: "Kid, they'll work you till you burn out. Literally."
- Zephyr seems unusually nervous about this topic - why? And why did she sneak out to come here?

---

#### Hook #2: Lucky's Scam Operation
**NPCs:** Lucky, Sarge, Pudge

Lucky sells "answers" to tomorrow's test (20 sovereigns). Sarge mutters warnings that nobody listens to. Pudge tries to stop people from buying.

**Hint Drop:** Sarge: "The test ain't about knowin' the book... it's about knowin' the *world*..."

---

#### Hook #3: Serra's Fire Pit
**NPCs:** Serra Vox, Cassius Thorne, Silas Thorne

Serra interviews students about clan culture. Cassius desperately tries to impress her by building elaborate fires and demonstrating textbook knowledge. Silas watches with amusement.

**Hint Drop:** Cassius mentions "Synchronized Helix" as correct manual answer (vs. "Dead-Stick Drop" which Val brags about).

---

#### Hook #4: The Legacy Table
**NPCs:** Valerius Sterling, Lady Glimmer, Kindle, Mira

Legacy Kids (descendants of famous explorers) show off knowledge and connections. Kindle (Ash-Blood) desperately tries to fit in. Glimmer makes cutting remarks about "unintegrated elements."

**Note:** Val is *wrong*—recommends flashy "Dead-Stick Drop" over textbook "Synchronized Helix."

---

#### Hook #5: The Grinder's Truth
**NPCs:** Ratchet, Brawn, Celia Vance, Theorem

Maintenance workers share stories over engine-hooch. Ratchet describes hull breach scenario: "A dead engine is a fancy coffin. You patch the ENGINE."

**Hint Drop:** Clear answer to Gen-Ed Question #4 (patch engine, not kitchen).

---

## NPC Knowledge Boundaries

**What Most Students Know:**
- Harmony governs from Vumbua Academy
- The Academy trains Exploranauts to map and integrate new territories
- **Two clans** have been discovered:
  - Ash-Bloods (volcanic fire people) - discovered 24 months ago, ~200 at Academy
  - Mizizi (fungal-turtle people) - discovered 4 months ago, only 3 at Academy (Britt, Aggie, Rill)
- Clan members are extremely rare (few hundred total among 70k students)
- The world outside is dangerous - void-beasts, unstable reality, death
- Harmony brings "stability" and "order" to chaotic territories
- Crystal batteries power everything (how they work is mysterious)
- Integration means cooperation, trade, mutual benefit

**Fringe Knowledge (conspiracy theorists, academics, some nobles):**
- The "Sixfold Theory" - fringe academic theory that there should be six clans
- Speculation about "missing" Earth and Lightning clans (most think this is nonsense)
- Some wonder if there are other undiscovered clans
- Theories that the two known clans might be connected somehow (very fringe)

**GM Secrets (Dean Isolde, researchers like Rill, maybe a few professors):**
- The clans are parts of an ancient system/circuit
- Integration percentages and why they matter
- The Imperial Archive / Mizizi forest data storage system
- The actual mechanics of "The Great Stitching"
- **That other clans exist** (Wadi, Trench-Kin, Renali are completely unknown to Harmony)

**CRITICAL:** When NPCs say "the clans," they mean Ash-Bloods and Mizizi. Period. They don't know Wadi, Renali, or Trench-Kin exist.

---

### Optional: Finding Rill

If Britt/Aggie actively seek Rill, they can find her in Fungal Research Labs (Block 12).

**Rill's Hint:** About Resonance Nodes—"If it's *weeping*, don't use Standard Protocol. Don't cure sadness with a hammer. You have to *cry with it*."

This answers Gen-Ed Question #2.

---

### Gen-Ed Test Structure

**Morning: Written Assessment** (10 questions, multiple choice)
- Players recall hints from Bonfire
- **Savant Answers** (10 pts): Riskier but "real-world" correct
- **Textbook Answers** (7 pts): Safe, Harmony-standard correct
- Mid-exam glitch: "Live Feed" from real explorer shows something terrifying before being cut

**Afternoon: Practical Simulations**
- Aether-Graph Plot (Agility)—Iggy has secret advantage (Trench-Kin navigation)
- Density Chamber (Constitution)—Iggy has secret advantage (high-pressure adapted)
- Blind Fly (Instinct)—Lomi has advantage (feel the gears)
- Tuning Injection (Tech/Dexterity)—Lomi has advantage (boiler experience)

---

*End of Campaign Chronicle*
