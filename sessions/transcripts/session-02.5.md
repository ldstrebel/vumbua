# Session 2.5: The Power Room

**Date:** 2026-02-16  
**Session Number:** 2.5  
**Players Present:** [[Iggy]] (Holly)  
**Type:** 1-on-1 side session (concurrent with Session 2 bonfire)

---

## Quick Summary

While the rest of the party socializes at the Block 99 bonfire, Iggy Irish-goodbyes and sneaks into the Academy's power plant. Inside, he meets Tommy (a gnome clerk), Lucina (a dwarf mechanic), and discovers the resonator battery infrastructure. Professor Kante, a tortoise professor of harmonics, finds Iggy sketching machinery and draws him into a deep conversation about the Global Amplitude, the Ash-Blood Anomaly, and the nature of Harmony's power — ending with an invitation to return and an umber crystal gift.

## Scenes

### Scene 1: The Irish Goodbye

**Location:** Block 99 Courtyard / Bonfire area  
**NPCs Present:** (background crowd)  
**Time:** Evening, Day 1

*GM Narration:*

[[Iggy]] has been socializing at the bonfire. He caught some of the conversation — the Ash-Blood population discussion (a couple hundred among 70,000 students), a nerdy guy by the fire who was poorly flirting with Serra, and the [[Mizizi]] clan explaining why death is a part of life. As Nick — as [[Ignatius]] got very excited about going to light the fire, and Ignatious was pulling people along — "come on, come on, let's go" — there was a moment where nobody was actively talking to Iggy.

He just kind of Irish-goodbyed. Didn't say anything to anybody. Slipped away the moment he could sneak out without them noticing.

At the same time, something else caught his eye: just next to where the fire was, the doors of the power plant flipped open for a second. He saw a bunch of cogs and machines and parts whirring inside. Someone walked out, the lights dimmed — and the door was not locked.

**Player Discoveries:**
- [[Iggy]] noticed [[Ignatius]] looking back at him — he wasn't completely ignored or forgotten
- He was starting to connect and fit in, but he's still prone to "shiny penny" moments
- The power plant door was left unlocked

**GM Notes:**
> [!NOTE]
> Holly confirmed that Iggy secretly enjoyed being included — when someone actually invited him to a party, "that's why he slid down so fast" from the crane. His grumpy side emerges when people interfere with what he wants to do, but he's not anti-social. His motivation for leaving: the cogs and machinery reminded him of home and his ultimate goal — gathering information about what's happening to his people.
>
> Holly also confirmed Iggy has never been caught sneaking anywhere. This is a combination of: (1) his parents had access everywhere in the Trench, (2) nobody ever really cared about him, and (3) he has a natural ability to blend in. He's not clumsy — "the nature of his people, they're so one with the soil, they are part of the earth."
>
> **Mechanics note:** GM and Holly discussed changing Iggy's wizard subclass abilities. Current version is healing/lightning bolts, which doesn't fit. New concept: a passive stealth ability he doesn't realize he's using (stress-triggered blending) + active earth manipulation (hope-spend hyper-fixation). Strange Patterns ability: when Iggy rolls a 7 on either die, he gains a hope and clears a stress.

### Scene 2: The Lobby — Tommy and Lucina

**Location:** Power Plant lobby, Walker-Core  
**NPCs Present:** [[Tommy]] (gnome clerk), [[Lucina]] (dwarf mechanic)  
**Time:** Evening, Day 1

*GM Narration:*

Iggy walks right up to the power plant — the building with "Vumbua POWER" over the archway — and opens the door. He's never been told he's not allowed to be anywhere, so he just walks right in.

Inside, all he can see is the very top of a red pointed hat, walking back and forth behind a desk.

**[[Tommy]]:** "Hello?"

**Iggy:** "Nime."

The gnome leans forward on the desk and looks down, revealing a cute, feminine bearded face with a pointy chin, big green eyes, and a pointy red hat. Very much like the goblin clerk in Harry Potter.

**Tommy:** "Oh, hello! Who are you?"

**Iggy:** "Nime."

**Tommy:** "Ah, very good, thank you, thank you, thank you for asking. Iggy. I am Tommy! Can I help you? Is there something you're looking for?"

**Iggy:** "Oh, no. Just lookin'. 'S nice to meet ya."

And he turns and walks away.

**Tommy:** *(muttering)* "Well, I guess it's nice to meet you too..." *(continues muttering to himself)* "Am I supposed to leave you a book? Can I let... dude, it's in here. Are you a student?"

As Iggy goes through, a dwarf comes around the corner — basically almost a cousin of the gnome but a little burlier, wearing mechanic overalls. Tommy is wearing a scribe/office clerk type of attire — button-up collar.

**[[Lucina]]:** "Oh, here — Tommy, did you let someone in? Are they lost?"

They both watched Iggy walk by. Neither of them really followed him. Lucina asked: "Are we allowed to let students back here?" — but nobody stopped him.

**Player Discoveries:**
- The power plant is staffed by non-students (Tommy is a clerk, Lucina is a maintenance worker)
- Security is minimal — nobody stopped Iggy from walking through
- Tommy wants to apply to [[Vumbua Academy]] next year

### Scene 3: The Warehouse Floor

**Location:** Power Plant main floor, Walker-Core  
**NPCs Present:** [[Marla]] (background, human maintenance worker)  
**Time:** Evening, Day 1

*GM Narration:*

Past the little lobby area, the space opens up into a large warehouse. Iggy is on a catwalk. The ground floor below has a bunch of machinery — glowing gems plugged into panels, connected to whirring cogs and rotating machines. Turbines being powered by something, lots of things spinning.

On the catwalk level, there is an office space — quite big, actually. It has the same glowing crystals that are on the panels. A couple of them sit in a cabinet. There's a big chalkboard with a bunch of scribbles on it.

The catwalk goes all the way around, with a couple of offices spread out on the top level. A staircase leads down to the ground floor. There's one other person — a tall human woman ([[Marla]]), her head bobbing in and out between the machines as she works with wrenches down below. Otherwise, no one else is back here.

Iggy pulls out his notepad and starts drawing everything in detail. He walks down the catwalk, sketching from what he can see, planning to eventually go downstairs to see it up close. As he draws, he looks up and notices that some of the things he's sketching are already drawn on the chalkboard in the office to the left.

He goes in to compare notes — not to copy someone else's work, but to check if they caught details he didn't. He trusts his own eye and knows he's more detailed than most.

**Player Discoveries:**
- The power plant uses glowing gems/crystals plugged into panels to power turbines
- The engineering is extensive — lots of interconnected machinery
- Someone has been drawing and annotating similar observations on a chalkboard

---

### Scene 4: The Chalkboard — Panda 5 Resonator Battery

**Location:** Power Plant office / chalkboard area  
**NPCs Present:** [[Professor Kante]] (appears mid-scene)  
**Time:** Late evening, Day 1

*GM Narration:*

Two items are on the chalkboard:

**Left side — "Panda 5 Resonator Battery" diagram:**
The blue box with all the arrows inside it matches the little glowing gems. They're about car-battery sized, with an internal matrix of hexes and triangles that glow softly. These are plugged into the panels downstairs. There's also a large filing cabinet with several of them stored inside. A bunch of terms Iggy wouldn't understand, but he can read all of it. The closest thing to what he's already drawn: a battery-looking thing with a handle and a little antenna sticking out of the top corner.

**Right side — Chart and annotations:**
A chart with words, numbers, red scratch-outs, stars, and question marks. A number keeps appearing: "[[The Power System|Global Amplitude]]" — the absolute highest amount of energy, the faucet turned on full. A red line drawn across, a blue line going right, then a second red line. The line tapers, plateaus, then starts to drop toward a dotted line.

*Knowledge roll: 22 with Hope*

Iggy is really able to get a good amount of learnings from this:

1. **Over-engineering:** The batteries have a lot more engineering than seems necessary. Extremely well built, but also *overbuilt* — designed to contain a force much larger than the force currently within them.

2. **Energy source:** These batteries are the source of everything that's moving. Instead of coal or gasoline, it's these battery things. Some machines have a dozen hooked in, some only have one or two. They seem to have the same amount of charge — you just need more for bigger tasks.

3. **Design philosophy:** Iggy is pretty positive he couldn't replicate any of this. But he understands there's some sort of energy it's meant to capture, and it's always capturing it. It tries not to let it go above a threshold. Like a water jug that instead of breaking when full, just overflows and doesn't let any more water in. Rather waste water than let the level drop below the top, or break the glass. The faucet is always on — they just want to keep the glass exactly the same level.

4. **The critical concern:** The second red line on the chart represents where the battery cup is meant to fill to. Below that red line is where all the question marks and panic live. "What happens if the cup is no longer full? If instead of getting rid of extra energy, we're now not getting the same amount of energy we're used to?" And then: **"Where is the Ash-Blood surge?"** — one big question mark written in red, right above where the projected dotted lines diverge.

About halfway through jotting down the board...

**[[Professor Kante]]:** "Hello."

He speaks slowly — every word deliberate. Like a slow Indian accent, careful and measured.

**Professor Kante:** "I have been watching you for a little while. You are student? What do you think?

**Iggy:** "Ya Got an interesting thing going on over here"

**Professor Kante:** "Indeed! What have you learned?"

Iggy is looking at a large tortoise — like the Master from Kung Fu Panda. Leaning on a cane, wearing a jaunty top hat, very dapperly dressed in a Bridgerton-style outfit. But his hands are covered in dust that matches the colors of the chalk on the board. He looks at Iggy with a lot of curiosity and openness. Zero suspicion.

**Iggy:** "I dunno where I am, who you are, what this is. I was just lookin' up here."


**Professor Kante:** "But wow, we are learning a lot. Where are you from? I don't recognize your accent."

**Iggy:** "We do not talk of it."

**Professor Kante:** "Oh, I did not mean to offend. I am most apologetic. Forgive me. I only meant to say — if you are not that familiar with the Panda 5, are you from somewhere rural? Do you not have power?"

**Iggy:** "Let's just say I'm not from around here. An' I don' know these parts. But I'm learnin' very fast. What can you tell me?"

**Professor Kante:** "What is one thing you have learned so far? What do you like, know? Yes, very much so."

*(He closes the door behind him.)*

**Professor Kante:** "I do not mean to interrogate you, but I saw the way that you are taking notes. And it was — I was thinking to myself — maybe he is understanding."

**Iggy:** "Well, 'course I understand."

**Professor Kante:** "You do? Maybe you can tell me what you think about the Ash-Blood surge."

**Iggy:** "I don't know nothin' about no [[Ash-Bloods]]. I just met the first two t'day. But I do feel like you got a big give‑and‑take situation over here, an' I don't know — my first Ash-Blood today, it was very exciting. It was very nice. It was many of them, the very few in the total, which doesn't make sense because of that. Anyways — sorry, don't get distracted. All the hullabaloo about Ash-Bloods — why are you asking me about that?"

**Player Discoveries:**
- The Panda 5 is the current generation of resonator battery
- Batteries are over-engineered surge protectors, not energy storage — they regulate a constant connection
- The [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] measures total ether energy across Harmony
- The amplitude is declining — something unprecedented
- "Where is the Ash-Blood surge?" is the central question on Kante's board
- Professor Kante has been observing Iggy and is impressed by his technical intuition

**GM Notes:**
> [!NOTE]
> Professor Kante appeared without Iggy noticing — he had been watching from the shadows. The chalk dust on his hands confirms this is his office and his work. He shows zero suspicion about Iggy's presence; his primary emotion is curiosity and intellectual excitement at finding a student who can grasp the technical material.

### Scene 5: The Lecture — Global Amplitude and the Minimum

**Location:** Power Plant office  
**NPCs Present:** Professor Kante  
**Time:** Late evening, Day 1

*GM Narration:*

Kante walks over to the board and starts pointing at the drawings. He begins with the basics — establishing the water metaphor that Iggy has already figured out — then goes deeper:

**Professor Kante:** "Well, forgive me. I don't want to just lecture you, but it sounds like maybe you could take some of your time to tell you about the resonator battery line."

**Iggy:** "Well, sure."

Kante walks to the board and starts explaining:

**Professor Kante:** "Let's just establish a couple of basic things here first."

He covers what Iggy already figured out — the water metaphor, the faucet, the overflow. Then:

**Professor Kante:** "Over the past... every major node... every major node that has been integrated into Harmony, it has brought with it a tremendous increase in Global Amplitude. But it has not happened yet for the [[Ash-Bloods]] — or it happened very little. It was very timely, because if it did not happen, then the Global Amplitude would have gone under the surge line and all of the Panda 5 batteries would have been outputting less than normal. It would have been the opposite of a Night of Sparks, and it would have been very bad."

*(pauses)* "Sorry. That probably did not make a lot of sense. I will rewind more. There is a reason this is my first year of teaching."

"Let us start with this. Do you know about the power of Harmony?"

**Iggy:** "No."

**Professor Kante:** "Okay. Well, Harmony, for a long time now — about a thousand years — has been a group of people that has gotten bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. But every time we integrate a new node, we all get a little bit stronger. And by all stronger, I mean specifically the Global Amplitude. This is the amount of power that Harmony gives to its citizens. And everyone who gets joined unto Harmony can access it through a resonator."

*(points at the little satellite dish on the corner of the battery)*

"This is the Panda 5. We don't exactly know why it happens, but it is like the power of life, of connection. It is something that everyone can use, but only if you have some of the technology that the Guild did give us — which is my family, but whatever. I'm here on different sponsorships. Not the important part."

"The power comes from connection. All of the different nodes who are getting connected into Harmony, they increase the amplitude for as long as we go."

*(goes back to the chart, pointing at the hexes and vertical lines on the graph)*

"Each time there has been a major increase — plus 100, plus 200. We have only been measuring for maybe two, three hundred years, and every time we have had a 100 or 200 increase to the Global Amplitude. And the last one was 300, which was huge."

*(pauses — the character fumbles on a name)* "That was when one of the biggest last nodes was integrated. Prima, with two crystals. Very exciting stuff."

"But the power of connection... the thing that makes the world run... how do you say... it is lonely. Maybe it really is powerful in the world's sentience — when the environment is alive. It is very special when there are people who talk. Some nodes not so powerful — just vicious. They don't give us a whole lot. But there are other places around the world that have given a whole lot."

"So when the Ash-Bloods came and they were integrated, with their cooling work and all, and they became part of Harmony — we thought, oh, it was going to be a huge surge. But they were just tiny. And I don't know why, because I'm here — my whole job — I am here to make sure that the surge that happens will not result in a second Night of Sparks."

*(points to the over-engineered aspects of the battery that Iggy had noticed)*

"Which was what happened last time. But before we had umber crystals, which meant that the entire world basically burned for like two months because there was too much power. Too much power. And so we had to build these."

"It has always been the case that once you join Harmony, you benefit from instant access to Harmony power. And that has been a great win for previous civilizations. But I do not understand why the Ash-Bloods — which should have been, by all classifications —"

*(goes down the list)* "Population. Size. Likeness of node type — the sun node, that means this was very easy energy to understand. It was not very complicated. Fire, heat — we have other places that make fire heat. We switch. We done."

"But for some reason, even though we see the Global Amplitude starting to increase again, there is just... so much to teach."

*(pauses, frustrated with himself)*

"I feel like I am talking around in circles. But important parts are this: it had been so long since the most previous known node was discovered that the Global Amplitude was starting to decline. First time ever. It was going down. Never have I ever recorded, for a prolonged period of time — maybe two, three months, six months go down, but it always comes up. Except for this time. The last 30 years, 40 years — continuing to go down. Not good. Not good for business. Not good for Harmony."

"So the Ash-Bloods were supposed to — this was easy. They also may hopefully save us. But they didn't. All they did was bring us back to less than where we were 50 years ago."

"So I think I am going to lose my job now, because I was supposed to build the next battery. And the Apex line is not even worth anything now because there is not enough surge."

*(At this point, the GM breaks to check Holly's understanding)*

> **Holly (OOC):** I think Iggy would be listening with the mindset of him trying to understand the pressure changes in his home. And I think — I don't know if he should be suspicious. That however they're harvesting this power has been hurting potentially their clan, as well as obviously the Ash-Bloods, because that would be a clear reason why they wouldn't be showing up. Is Harmony the enemy? Or is there an external factor affecting both?
>
> **GM (OOC):** The general vibe Iggy is getting is that there is nothing that Harmony is doing to *pull* anything from the Ash-Bloods. They're not like a new source of oil being harvested. It's more like — Harmony is a ship with many oars. Some oars are pulled by really strong individuals, some are small. What happened is the Ash-Bloods joined as a new oarsman, but instead of outputting like a big Goliath, they're outputting like a tiny child. All the metrics say it should have been as powerful as one of the biggest oarsmen. But for some reason, it's not. All oarsmen on the ship are at the end of the round the same — they just happen to output more power.

Kante continues, now on the topic of what makes integration work:

**Professor Kante:** "There is a very specific exchange that has to happen between the energies."

*(The GM notes that Kante has a bit of a Galileo vibe — a genius scientist who doesn't agree with the rest of the population)*

Kante's theories are based on the idea that the connection between peoples — the exchange between the Ash-Bloods and Harmony — was about exchanging the same energy for the same purpose, which built the connection. But Iggy's people — the Trench — haven't done anything like that. There's been no exchange. And it's very obvious to everyone that things immediately change as soon as that connection is made.

The Ash-Bloods' story: they were experiencing fluctuations before integration. Then after Harmony joined, there was a spike. They always talk about it in terms of heat — there was the Great Cooling, then things started to flutter and heat up like embers, and after integration, the island started to feel alive again. That's why the Ash-Blood clan is so invested in Harmony — because the Great Cooling is now reversed.

> **Holly (OOC):** So is Iggy walking away from this conversation feeling like Harmony is truly trying to solve it, or is Harmony the enemy?
>
> **GM (OOC):** He doesn't know a lot about Harmony, but he knows Kante, who seems like a kindred soul — a bit of an outsider. Well-dressed, clearly a normal member of society, but there's something that Harmony doesn't understand either about this energy. They seem to have an entirely different problem. But a similar, different problem.

> **Holly (OOC):** If this connection and knowing about other cultures is so important — why does the Exchange happen where the person has to be forced to forget? Like, if connection is important and learning about everyone's culture — we're destroying connection.
>
> **GM (OOC):** That's a really good insight for Iggy to ask. But Iggy hasn't had enough time to know what Harmony's culture is and what they do and don't do. The Exchange is a niche, once-every-three-to-five-years thing that happens in the clans. Probably few people know it exists.

**Professor Kante:** "That seems to have made you think of something."

**Iggy:** "Knowin' where you're from, an' embracin' where I'm from. I don't know if it's normal or not. There is this thing called the Exchange."

**Professor Kante:** "The Exchange? I have not heard of this."

**Iggy:** "It introduces somebody new. But we don't know — they're not able to tell us the connection."

**Professor Kante:** "Very interesting. If I gave you a map, would you be able to show me which part of Harmony you're from?"

**Iggy:** *(deflects)*

**Professor Kante:** "Sorry sorry sorry it is just that I very, very much want to know — I did not mean... that is the second time. Forgive me. It is very... there are some very small sects in Harmony. I have heard — not as integrated with the rest of society, but they still use the Harmony resonator batteries. You must be from a very special place, but also one that I don't think I would want to live in, if you don't mind me saying."

"The connection between people is very important. And not knowing it is causing me physical pain — not to ask you where you're from — because I want to build this connection with you. It is very important. It's how we grow up. It is very important to our kind."

**Iggy:** "We protect each other. An' we don't think of the westward danger from Aether beasts."

**Professor Kante:** "What type of danger?"

**Professor Kante:** *(deadpan)* "Your home sounds like a very hard place to live."

**Professor Kante:** *(starts sliding his hand down the x-axis of the chart, past the Ash-Blood green line, past dates — 84, 10, 363, 30)* "If I mean quite honest, there is not — as far as I know, and I know, but I think good about history — the last major conflict between peoples was hundreds of years ago. We left on this chart."

"So the only other... perhaps... I do not want to undermine our connection by hypothesizing what you are from. But there are other places in the the Vane's who are responsible for guarding our borders from very serious threats. Especially when the amplitude started to decline, the threats got very real. So I do understand this need for protection."

"But maybe I'll leave you with this: it is hard to defend alone. The thing that makes Harmony able to defend from the Aether beasts was the connections between the other peoples."

*(begins listing the cultural contributions)*

"The iron from the Sinter. The Chime Spires from the Guild. The life soil from the Felt Land. The trail tales from the Trench. The silent silt. Elysium snows."

"All of these are very important to defending. And I don't know that they would have been able to do it alone. This may be something that — if you ever find the way back to your clan — you can share there."

"I would very much like it if you came back for more. Next time, have tea."

*(pats Iggy on the back and starts ushering him toward the door)*

"You have an interesting treat — and you are a very, very happy entire student. But it is now late, and you do need to get back to the bonfire and your friends. Marla here, she will take you out."

**Player Discoveries:**
- **The Global Amplitude** is Harmony's total ether power — it increases when new nodes are integrated
- **The power comes from connection** — from people being linked together, not from resource extraction
- **Historical pattern**: Each major node integration adds +100 to +300 to the amplitude; last big one was +300 from "Prima"
- **The Decline**: For the last 30-40 years, the Global Amplitude has been continuously declining — unprecedented in recorded history
- **The Ash-Blood Anomaly**: Integration should have produced +300 to +800 amps; actual result was only ~20 amps
- **The Night of Sparks** (~400 years ago): A surge before umber crystals existed caused the world to burn for two months
- **Panda 5 batteries are regulators, not storage** — they cap the faucet and output consistent energy; they are "receptors"
- **The Apex line was scrapped** — Kante's next-gen battery designed for a post-surge world is now useless
- **Kante's theory**: The key to integration is connection between cultures — finding something so internal to your culture that it bridges the divide. Like two tribes discovering fire separately and teaching each other the word for flame.
- **The [[Trench-Kin]] are known to Harmony** — Kante mentions "trail tales from the Trench" as part of what defends Harmony's borders
- **The Exchange ritual is unknown to Kante** — this surprises him, suggesting it's a clan-only practice
- **Kante suspects Iggy is from an isolated, unintegrated sect** but doesn't push further

**GM Notes:**
> [!NOTE]
> **Critical dramatic irony**: Iggy is [[Trench-Kin]] — one of the "missing siblings" whose unintegrated status is contributing to the Ash-Blood Anomaly. If Kante knew what Iggy was, the mystery might be half-solved.
>
> Holly's key insight: "If connection is so important, why does the Exchange force people to forget?" — this is the exact right question that neither Kante nor Harmony has considered. The Exchange is a clan practice that may be undermining the very connections Kante says are essential.
>
> Iggy's takeaway is confusion: he's been told his whole life that connection with the outside world would make his world die. This person is telling him the complete opposite.
>
> Kante's mention of "trail tales from the Trench" confirms the Trench-Kin are known to Harmony as border defenders, but he doesn't connect Iggy to them.

### Scene 6: The Gift and the Night

**Location:** Power Plant → Iggy's bunk  
**NPCs Present:** Professor Kante  
**Time:** Late night, Day 1

*GM Narration:*

As Kante ushers Iggy toward the door — slowly, giving plenty of time to talk:

**Professor Kante:** "If you want to come and experiment in my laboratory, you are very, very welcome. I would very much like to have a second mind. The other ones — they like to fix things. They don't like to *think* about them."

**Iggy:** "I would like that."

Kante reaches into his coat and gives Iggy a small black crystal in his hand.

**Professor Kante:** "This is an umber crystal. The same thing — a resonator crystal."

*(points into the battery center)*

As Iggy compares the crystal in his hand to the matrix that makes up the battery, he realizes: it's the same material. This umber crystal is integral to how the battery is designed. And really, they shouldn't be calling it a "battery" — it's more like a "receptor." Its entire job is to take energy and cap it and output consistent energy. Because the amplitude is always fluttering up and down, it stores a little energy for the small dips, but that's not what it's for. It's mostly acting as a surge capacitor.

**Professor Kante:** *(final farewell)* "Next time, have tea. A hot honey — very soothing."

Iggy takes the umber crystal back to his bunk. He pulls out his notebook and starts sketching — not studying, exactly, but creating models with his little collected things. He's trying to fix the battery. To solve the questions on the board. He can't sort out the connection piece yet, but he can put his hands on something: trying to figure out how to make this little battery thing more efficient.

He scratches down five experiments he could run to test connection throughout the night with people — a little crossover from Kante's philosophy into practical testing.

Eventually, the rest of the group returns from the bonfire and heads out for late-night drinks at the Celestial Lounge. Iggy has been up late, tinkering. He sees his new friends walk by, dawn-lit and heading out for more. He decides to join them — partly to distract himself from the conversation about connection buzzing in his head, and partly as a little experiment: testing connection with others.

**Player Discoveries:**
- **Umber crystals** are the core component of resonator batteries — Iggy now has one
- Batteries are "receptors," not storage — they act as surge capacitors
- Professor Kante invited Iggy to return for further collaboration
- Iggy has begun designing experiments to test the concept of connection

**GM Notes:**
> [!NOTE]
> Iggy now has a physical piece of the power infrastructure — an umber crystal. The GM noted they're heavy (Iggy couldn't have stolen a full battery), but this crystal is small enough to pocket.
>
> Holly's description of Iggy's night: he's creating models, sketching versions, trying to solve the unsolvable. He wants to put his hands on the problem. Five experiments to "test connection" throughout the night — using the Celestial Lounge outing as a field test for Kante's theory.

---

## Session Outcomes

### Character Development
- **[[Iggy]]:** Major turning point. His worldview is being challenged — he's been told his whole life that connection with the outside world would destroy his people, but Kante argues the opposite. He's confused but intellectually engaged. Gained a mentor figure in Kante, an umber crystal, and five experiments to run. His natural technical aptitude was validated.

### Party Relationships
- [[Iggy]] Irish-goodbyed from the bonfire but rejoined the group for the Celestial Lounge trip
- He noticed [[Ignatius]] looking back at him — the connection is building even when Iggy wanders
- Iggy is now running "connection experiments" with his new friends

### World State Changes
- **[[Professor Kante]]** is now an active NPC — he's recruited Iggy as a collaborator
- **The Ash-Blood Anomaly** is now directly known to Iggy (but not the rest of the party)
- **The [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] decline** has been revealed (to one player)
- Iggy possesses an **umber crystal** — a physical piece of the power infrastructure
- Iggy mentioned **the Exchange** to Kante, who had never heard of it

### Cliffhangers / Hooks for Next Session
- Kante invited Iggy to return for tea and more research
- Iggy has five experiments about connection to test
- The question of why the Ash-Blood surge didn't materialize remains open
- Iggy's confusion about connection vs. isolation — a philosophical thread that will define his arc
- How will Iggy's knowledge of the power crisis intersect with what the rest of the party learns?

---

## Lore Updates

- [x] Update [[Professor Kante]] — now met by [[Iggy]]
- [x] Update [[Knowledge Tracker]] — [[Iggy]] now knows about GA decline, batteries, anomaly
- [x] Update [[Timeline]] — Session 2.5 is no longer [Planned]
- [x] Update [[Iggy]] — new mechanics, umber crystal, Kante connection
- [x] Add new entries about umber crystals and Panda 5 to [[Glossary]]

---

## GM Reflections

### What Worked Well
- The slow reveal through [[Iggy]]'s own technical aptitude — he figured out the battery philosophy *before* Kante explained it
- Kante's voice and personality — the slow-speaking tortoise professor was charming and memorable
- Holly's player instincts — the Exchange question was the exact right insight
- The umber crystal as a physical takeaway — gives [[Iggy]] something to tinker with

### Adjustments for Next Time
- Kante's lecture could be tighter — he acknowledges "I feel like I am talking around in circles"
- [[Marla]] (human mechanic on the floor) was present but never interacted with Iggy — could be revisited in a future visit for her backstory about failing out of the Academy

### Future Plot Threads to Develop
- Iggy's five connection experiments — what does he test? What does he learn?
- Return visit to Kante's lab — deeper investigation into the Ash-Blood Anomaly
- What happens when Iggy tells (or doesn't tell) the party about what he learned?
- Kante's Galileo-like position — will his theories be vindicated or suppressed?
- The umber crystal — could Iggy build or modify something with it?
