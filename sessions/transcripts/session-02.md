## Scenes

### Scene 1: Establishing Shot -- Vumbua Academy

**Location:** [[Vumbua Academy]] campus, night of the first day
**NPCs Present:** None (establishing)
**Time:** Evening

The night of the first day of school. Students have made it through intake and the Culling. Vumbua is a repurposed expedition city: the Main Hall, the sprawling courtyard, and the Spire-Scape (a chaotic mix of temporary scaffolding and dorms clinging to the permanent cores). Airships zoom overhead.

In the main courtyard, students light bonfires using construction trash. Over in the northwest "High-Rise" district, wealthy Legacy students hold formal receptions. The [[Ash-Bloods]] stand out---only ~200 of them among 70,000 students, mostly wearing black because of soot, their skin glowing.

### Scene 2: The Bonfire & The Spark

**Location:** Block 99 (Industrial District), a makeshift fire pit
**NPCs Present:** [[Cassius Thorne]]
**Time:** Evening

[[Lomi]] approaches [[Ignatius]] near a fire pit where Cassius (a nervous student) is trying to arrange logs with mathematical precision. Lomi lights a scrap of paper and hands it to Ignatius, who casually tosses it into the pit. The fire erupts instantly.

Cassius panics: *"No! It was not ready! The thermal distribution was---this is very non-optimal!"*

[[Lomi]] rolls a critical success on Instinct to charm him. Cassius calms down, cheeks rosy, glancing over at [[Serra Vox]] nearby. *"I have to admit, I wasn't planning to come here tonight. But I felt like this was the place to be."*

**Player Discoveries:**
- Cassius is a nervous, bookish student obsessed with optimal thermal distribution
- He has a visible crush on [[Serra Vox]]

---

### Scene 3: First Contact -- Serra Vox

**Location:** Near the fire pit
**NPCs Present:** Seraphina "Serra" Vox
**Time:** Evening

Serra approaches [[Britt]] and [[Aggie]], struggling to lead conversation but clearly wanting to interrogate them. She's nervous and eager, calling the gathering "the most important anthropological cauldron in years."

She claims to be from the far east side of the main continent (near Settika). When asked about Harmony's capital: *"The Seat of Harmony. It's the biggest city... huge. 8 million people. Honestly, it's a little big for my taste. I've unfortunately had to spend quite a lot of time in The Seat."*

[[Britt]] tries to charm her to get more info (rolls Presence: 11, Failure with Fear). Serra shuts down, realizing she said too much about "political pressure."

**Player Discoveries:**
- Serra claims to be from the east (near Settika) but slipped about spending time in The Seat under political pressure
- Harmony Seat has ~8 million people
- Serra is hiding something about her background

---

### Scene 4: The Speculators' Debate

**Location:** Nearby the fire
**NPCs Present:** [[Percival Vane-Smythe III|Percy Vane-Smythe III]], [[Iron-Jaw Jax]] (Warforged), [[Bramble]] (Plant-kin), [[Zephyr]]
**Time:** Evening

An argument breaks out. [[Percival Vane-Smythe III|Percy]] (well-dressed, Bridgerton-style outfit) is loudly theorizing:

*"I'll wager 50 sovereigns that there's an Earth clan underground! We've got Plants, Fire... there's going to be Water, Earth, Air---it's got to be all sorts of other ones!"*

[[Iron-Jaw Jax|Jax]] dismisses it: *"That's nonsense. We found [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Blood]] and Maze. That's probably all there is."*

[[Bramble]] (plant-kin) offers a philosophical counter: *"What if they are not the missing? What if we are the ones who forgot?"*

[[Zephyr]] (platinum-haired girl): *"Or maybe the world is just broken. Not everything needs to be a pattern."*

Lomi steps in, mentioning noises heard in the boiler room and his belief in friendly underground people. [[Percival Vane-Smythe III|Percy]] is delighted: *"Salt of the earth!"* He introduces himself as [[Percival Vane-Smythe III|Percy Vane-Smythe III]].

[[Ignatius]] loses interest in the topic. Lomi and Percy bond. Zephyr interrupts wanting "storms and grease."

**Player Discoveries:**
- The "Sixfold Theory" exists: the idea that Plants, Fire, Ash-Blood, and [[Mizizi]] are known, but Earth, Air, and Water clans must exist to complete the symmetry
- Percy is a genuine theorist, not just a rich kid
- [[Iron-Jaw Jax|Jax]] is a skeptic warforged (young, still has "curves," hasn't slimmed out)
- Bramble is a thoughtful plant-kin philosopher
- [[Trench-Kin|Earthkin]] are a common enough race in Harmony (not the same as a hypothetical Earth Clan)

### Scene 5: Philosophy of Death

**Location:** Near the fire pit
**NPCs Present:** Serra Vox
**Time:** Late evening

Serra returns to Britt and [[Aggie]] after stepping away. She's flustered about possibly offending them.

Serra explains that every discovered place has a "purpose"---a reason it exists. The [[Mizizi]] forest is unusual because its purpose is unclear beyond "surviving and living."

Britt responds directly: *"Death is the way of things. Without death, there can be nothing new."*

This leads to a profound cultural exchange. Aggie mentions her grandmother passing two years ago. Serra offers condolences; Aggie responds with *"Congratulations!"*---confused by the sympathy, since death is simply returning to the cycle.

Serra is horrified but fascinated: *"I think... I think they really like death."*

**Player Discoveries:**
- Harmony culture disguises death in "weird rhymes that children sing" and avoids the topic
- The Mizizi forest doesn't have a clear "purpose" like other nodes---this is unusual and noted by scholars
- Mizizi view death as natural and celebrate the cycle; Harmony culture fears death
- There's a problem in the forest: "too much life"---things aren't dying properly

### Scene 6: Ash-Blood Politics & The Inverse Power

**Location:** Near the fire pit
**NPCs Present:** Serra Vox
**Time:** Late evening

Serra asks Ignatius about Ash-Blood energy. He pulls out a piece of leidian (obsidian-like heat stone) from his pocket, explaining their clothes are designed to withstand heat and that [[Ash-Bloods]] release heat by burning hotter rather than sweating.

Ignatius explains the Ash-Bloods were going through a "Great Cooling"---their volcanoes were dying---but when Harmony found them, the heat picked back up. He mentions [[Lady Ignis]] as a prominent member of Harmony.

Serra corrects him: [[Lady Ignis]] holds the **highest voting power** in all of Harmony. She explains the **Inverse Power Doctrine**: Harmony grants the newest integrated member the highest voting power to prevent exploitation. *"The least of us should become the most of us."*

This is because: in the past, making new members a minority caused strife. The people who live in the new lands should make decisions about their resources. It's kept the peace for a thousand years.

Aggie begins connecting dots about Harmony's pattern: giving clans everything they want to figure out the exchange value.

Serra also reveals that the Mizizi haven't been formally integrated yet---no seat, just a "semi-short-term weapons trade."

**Player Discoveries:**
- **The Inverse Power Doctrine**: newest integrated member gets highest voting power
- Lady Ignis is essentially "President" of Harmony
- Ash-Bloods release heat by burning hotter (thermodynamic heat transfer), not sweating
- Leidian doesn't burn through Ash-Blood clothing (designed for heat resistance)
- Ash-Bloods were going through a "Great Cooling" before Harmony found them
- The Mizizi have NOT been formally integrated (no seat at Harmony)
- Harmony's pattern: give new clans everything, figure out the exchange, then formalize integration

### Scene 7: The Lightning Incident

**Location:** The fire pit
**NPCs Present:** Zephyr, Real/[[Rill]] (Dean's assistant/Mizizi exchange)
**Time:** Late evening

Lomi returns from [[Lucky]]'s corner with six jars of "Engine Grease" (moonshine). Zephyr runs over immediately: *"Oh! Things to drink! I love drinking things."*

Lomi takes a swig and spits it into the fire, creating a fireball. Zephyr tries---chokes on the first attempt, then tries again. She bottles it up, turns purple, her hair stands up with static electricity...

Two things happen at once: she spits the grease into the fire AND a massive **purple lightning bolt** crackles down from the clear sky, strikes her, then slams back down. BOOM.

Zephyr, unharmed: *"That one was pretty good."*

Jax's jaw literally falls off. The whole bonfire area is stunned.

Suddenly, **Real/[[Rill]]** appears from the crowd, grabs Zephyr by the arm: *"There you are! We've been looking all over for you."* Zephyr protests but is lured back with promises of hot chocolate.

Ignatius yells after them: *"What's [[Zephyr|Lightning Girl]]'s name?"*

Rill: *"Her name is Zephyr, [[Ignatius|Lava Boy]]."* She spots Britt and Aggie, waves happily, and tells them to come find her tomorrow after class---points to the grass-covered building inset into the hill.

**Player Discoveries:**
- Zephyr can cause purple lightning---seemingly involuntarily triggered by the grease
- She was unharmed by the bolt
- Rill/Real is the Dean's assistant and was previously an exchange to the Mizizi clan
- Rill recognizes Britt and Aggie, wants to meet after class
- Rill's base is in the grass-covered building built into the hill
- Zephyr is being managed/watched by Rill on behalf of the Dean

### Scene 8: Grinder Talk & The Heat Spike

**Location:** The fire pit
**NPCs Present:** Serra Vox
**Time:** Late evening

Serra whispers that Rill was the Dean on stage earlier---*"one of the greatest inventors in our age"*---and lived in the Mizizi village as an exchange student.

Lomi introduces himself properly to Britt and Aggie as "[[Lomi|Lomi Sultano]], Boiler Room, [[Iron-Union|Diamond Union]]." Engine Grease is the drink of choice down there. Britt and Aggie prefer Pine Needle Tea.

The conversation turns to the boiler room's power sources: condensed crystal batteries and leidian (the obsidian heat stone from Ash-Blood isle). Ignatius names it "Leidian" on the spot (lava + obsidian).

The GM reveals to Lomi that leidian has been measuring **80% more heat per gram** in the last two years since integration. People have been overbuying it, and boilers are exploding because it's too hot. Leidian also has a sort of "halflife"---heat tapers off then rises again---and loses some potency with distance from Ash-Blood isle.

Ignatius shares his personal motivation: find a new source of leidian or discover why it's reheating. *"I want to find the heart of the volcano."*

Serra/Aggie mention [[Ember]]---an Ash-Blood who is excited to use Harmony's "clean" energy and refuses to touch organic fire. Ignatius considers this disrespectful to Ash-Blood heritage.

**Player Discoveries:**
- Leidian is burning 80% hotter per gram in the last 2 years (since integration)
- Leidian has a halflife oscillation (heat tapers then rises again)
- Leidian loses some potency with distance from Ash-Blood isle
- The boiler room uses both crystal batteries and leidian
- There's a cultural divide among Ash-Bloods: traditionalists (Ignatius) vs modernizers ([[Ember]])
- Ember is Ignatius's childhood cousin who prefers Harmony's clean energy
- Ignatius's personal goal: find a new heat source or understand why leidian is reheating

### Scene 9: The Celestial Lounge

**Location:** Campus, heading northwest
**NPCs Present:** None (establishing)
**Time:** Late night

The bonfire winds down. The group decides to check out the Celestial Lounge before bed.

Walking across campus, they pass classrooms, dormitories, and worker housing. Outside the campus fence on the northwest side: three huge manors and a line of ritzy shops. The Golden Welcome (a fraternity-style party in a manor) is winding down. Bouncers at doors aren't checking IDs, but students can voluntarily reveal their rank receipts to get gold pins and VIP access.

On the top floor of the tallest building: the **Celestial Lounge**.

Session ends with the party heading inside for a nightcap before classes begin.

**Player Discoveries:**
- Campus layout: northwest side has the "fancy district" with manors, shops, and clubs
- The Celestial Lounge is an upscale club on the top floor of the tallest building in the fancy district
- Social stratification: rank receipts can be flashed for VIP access, but it's voluntary (no one checks)
