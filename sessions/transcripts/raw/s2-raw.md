## Session 0 \- Transcript

### 00:00:00

   
**GM or Aggie:** Key thing for the transcription is that this person speaking, Lucas S, will be sharing the same transcript line as Christina Rain, who will be playing Aggie. So when it comes to deconliction, use context clues throughout the transcript to know who is speaking. I, Luke, also play the GM for multiple characters. So keep that in mind. This is session three. We are about to begin. Sorry. Session two. Session two. Ow. Thank you. What a

**GM or Aggie:** Yeah, I uh I tried this thing that I like imported all of our stuff into an actual like code GitHub repository so that I could have like the actually update the source files as I build more things and now I have so much like so much content that I uh don't know I can't go back I didn't really mean to, but um and then I'm realizing like, okay, I know everything about this world, but how do you play the game?

### 00:13:06

   
**GM or Aggie:** Yes, I should say. That's great. H. So to you can spend hope to roll any dice to add a detail to the scene to boost an alley or to ask the GM a question. Here those are all like wait if you can spin hope. I'm going to fact check  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** that.  
**Luke Foreman:** Make sure that's right.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. So you can apply a character's  
**John Hagey:** Yes. Yes.  
**GM or Aggie:** background experience to a role for a bonus.  
**John Hagey:** Yes.

**GM or Aggie:** Goes good.  
**John Hagey:** Nice goes  
**GM or Aggie:** How goes you? Good. Good.  
**John Hagey:** good.  
**GM or Aggie:** Did y'all um look at your character sheets at all and  
**John Hagey:** Not in the world.  
**GM or Aggie:** switch  
**Luke Foreman:** I did last session um looked through it looked through all the features and stuff.  
**GM or Aggie:** be a good thing to do while we're hanging out. did not look at my character sheet in any functional way, but I did show it to my caption because he was cute.  
**John Hagey:** Last time I did look at the features and stuff.  
**GM or Aggie:** How did you Did you just pull up your laptop while you were at the hotel or something or No, I pulled it up on my phone. It was not ideal, but it worked. It worked well enough for him to get the  
**John Hagey:** Hey Luke,  
**GM or Aggie:** idea.  
**John Hagey:** Christina, make sure when you're planting the seeds and stuff that you make sure that the seeds have solid ground contact. It's very important for wild flowers to have solid ground contact.  
   
 

### 00:17:20

   
**John Hagey:** If they're just on top of some or something,  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay.  
**John Hagey:** they will not f\*\*\*\*\*\* grow. If they are not touching soil and wet, they won't grow. I did a lot of research on wild flower.  
**GM or Aggie:** I mean, it's supposed to be raining tomorrow, so at least there's the moisture in the next day.  
**John Hagey:** Perfect.  
**GM or Aggie:** I know.  
**John Hagey:** Perfect.  
**GM or Aggie:** Those been delivered right. Yeah, I think I think I need to work this into like a simplified journal. This one. What do you know?  
**John Hagey:** Hey, Foreman. Quick question. Um, from the ice storm when you said that that one hole got particularly harder,  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** was that was that the hole that I helped you set up and immediately launched it out of bounds?  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** Good. I'm glad the f\*\*\*\*\*\*  
**Luke Foreman:** Yep.  
**John Hagey:** tree fell.  
**Luke Foreman:** That was that was the one  
**GM or Aggie:** Can't forget a pan. It's not joining. music.  
   
 

### 00:20:10

   
**GM or Aggie:** Fire. They're great.  
**John Hagey:** I'm getting I'm getting in the roll.  
**GM or Aggie:** Getting into character.  
**John Hagey:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** Fire. I would love to see a picture of like your big scary looking dude with like 10 minutes. She like looking at so  
**John Hagey:** I have this entire box of matches that they gave me to try and light their grill because their grill wasn't Turns out they had turned the gas off and the person working didn't know how to turn it back on. And then I was like,  
**Luke Foreman:** Wait.  
**John Hagey:** "I'm pretty sure it's this valve right here." And she was like, "No, it's not that valve." I'm like, "That's a yellow pipe. Pretty sure that's a gas pipe." And it's the only one here, so I'm pretty sure that's it. And for like 20 minutes, she was like, "No, it's not that." I was like, "I'm just going to try it." And I turned it on and immediately had a fire going. I was like, "That's definitely the gas valve." Anyway,  
   
 

### 00:21:15

   
**John Hagey:** the more you  
**GM or Aggie:** nailed it. Yeah. You know,  
**John Hagey:** know.  
**GM or Aggie:** I feel like starting a grill is is more scary than it should be on a grill that I don't  
**John Hagey:** Oh, this one is because it's not like a propane grill.  
**GM or Aggie:** know.  
**John Hagey:** It is like in it is like part of the natural gas system. And uh it was one of those things where I was like we had the knobs are f\*\*\*\*\*\* awful. They don't turn right. They're all busted. Some of them have like hot glue or epoxy in them.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** They still pop right off. They don't turn right. And there was literally a moment of me and my buddy like, "How many of these do we have on?" And when it turned on, it it there there was a there was a little bit of an explosion. I was like, "Oh s\*\*\*.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, I could see that if you're trying to get it lit for a while and then eventually do  
   
 

### 00:22:06

   
**John Hagey:** It It could have been way worse. The the issue was like we were messing with the knobs for so long and they were all jacked up and you couldn't tell if they were open or not that when we turned on the gas it was just immediately pumping gas out. So when we lit it, it was going. It could have been way worse if the gas was on and we didn't know and we had left it like that for a long period of  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah,  
**John Hagey:** time.  
**Luke Foreman:** true.  
**John Hagey:** But we got it, you know, we got it. We had some stakes. It was a good time.  
**Luke Foreman:** Nice.  
**John Hagey:** Man, I haven't seen snow at all this year.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, it it was so unfortunate cuz Nashville was right on the line of getting a whole bunch of snow or getting that ice and not We still got like a couple inches, two or three inches of snow,  
**John Hagey:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** but then it could have been close to a foot uh which would have been really fun.  
   
 

### 00:23:08

   
**John Hagey:** And then the ice just even ruined everything. That would have been awesome.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** I've decided that I like snow, but only if I'm prepared for the snow. Like, if you get snowed in and you're prepared for it,  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** it's actually f\*\*\*\*\*\* awesome. Like, oh, I guess I'm just hanging out at home and playing in the snow for a week.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** But if you're like having to drive and move a lot in the snow, it kind of sucks.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah. Yeah. And then losing losing power. That's like a that's a huge thing.  
**GM or Aggie:** Valid.  
**John Hagey:** Yeah, I mean that's a huge thing, but like I have it in my head that like, you know, if you have a little bit of a property with like a place with a fireplace and you have natural gas, like yeah,  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** that's you're fine. You'll be okay. But not having any of those things and just being cold,  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:23:56

   
**John Hagey:** having a newborn baby, those things suck.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah. That uh was not ideal. Um  
**John Hagey:** And then you leave to go to your in-laws house and then they lose power and turns out your power is fine, but then you're trapped in because of the eye so you can't go  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, it was a whole it was a whole thing.  
**John Hagey:** back  
**Luke Foreman:** But I mean, it ended up being fine. And then Sophie and Ryan and Willow came and stayed with us, which was fun. Ended up being Yeah,  
**John Hagey:** and your and the grandparents.  
**Luke Foreman:** they did. They ended up not staying.  
**John Hagey:** Okay.  
**Luke Foreman:** They should have, honestly, but we would have made it work. But they went back and my parents had the fire in their house going and they slept in the in  
**John Hagey:** Nice.  
**Luke Foreman:** the room that has the fireplace. Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** Nice.  
**Luke Foreman:** So, they stayed pretty warm, which is  
**John Hagey:** Good deal.  
**Luke Foreman:** good.  
**John Hagey:** Hey, when do they start the Great Loop?  
   
 

### 00:24:54

   
**Luke Foreman:** TBD. It It depends on like grandparents' health and um my mom is retiring supposedly at  
**John Hagey:** But who's going to be the librarian at at Father  
**Luke Foreman:** the end of this year.  
**John Hagey:** Ryan?  
**Luke Foreman:** It was supposed to not me. It was supposed to be uh last year and then she wanted one more year and now I don't I don't know if she's officially decided whether it's going to be this year or not. It should be. needs to be. But we'll see. We'll see what they do. But if she does retire, I still think I still don't think they'll do it all at once. I think they'll do it in in chunks and like fly back for a month and then get back to the boat and start going  
**John Hagey:** That's fair.  
**Luke Foreman:** again.  
**John Hagey:** I mean, it's a it's a it's a it's a long distance to be going.  
**Luke Foreman:** It's a long way. Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** I I've talked to I've run into a few people here and there just through traveling that have done it before and they uh especially down in like Florida, like you run into some boat people every now and then and some of them like some of them will go they'll put their boat wherever and they'll stay in a hotel for like a week in a city that they like before they're ready to move on.  
   
 

### 00:26:07

   
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it can be like easily a year if especially if you take there's like a lot of um detours you can take into the Bahamas or into the the other Caribbean islands. So,  
**John Hagey:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** if you take all of those two on top of just the length of the the trip itself, it's it'd be a lot be long. Super  
**John Hagey:** True.  
**Luke Foreman:** long.  
**GM or Aggie:** Praise Jesus.  
**Luke Foreman:** Let's see.  
**GM or Aggie:** Honey,  
**Luke Foreman:** Welcome  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** You're welcome.  
**GM or Aggie:** honey,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Hey,  
**Luke Foreman:** Should  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** how's it going?  
**GM or Aggie:** honey.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Well,  
**Luke Foreman:** you go  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I will She went down finally. Um,  
**Luke Foreman:** down?  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I will be visible in just a second. I had to just finish putting away her food from dinner.  
**GM or Aggie:** No worries. I'm just uh sharing some some how to play dagger heart rules in Foundry.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I could have could have used  
   
 

### 00:28:20

   
**GM or Aggie:** journal.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** that.  
**Luke Foreman:** It's in the journal, right?  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Yes,  
**Luke Foreman:** You can pull it  
**GM or Aggie:** it'll be  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Okay,  
**GM or Aggie:** available.  
**Luke Foreman:** up.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** great.  
**GM or Aggie:** Not so bad. Some of the the interesting things are like um like you have uh you know the dual the two dice we've talked about backtory we've talked about there's a couple of things you can spend hope on which uh I'll show this one to just because why not  
**Luke Foreman:** outside of just like general character sheet stuff because I have a  
**GM or Aggie:** and  
**Luke Foreman:** I have a few Yeah. Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** A lot of a few of my skills or whatever take hope.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Yeah. So that's like the primary engine, but then that you can always do these other things.  
**Luke Foreman:** Gotcha. Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, now that utilize an experience one I didn't think was true because I thought that was like the whole point of having the experiences.  
   
 

### 00:29:32

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um using her publicly. Yeah, I guess they do have to use it. That's interesting. Um, so we we can be like a lot more loosey goosey about experiences. They're not just skills. They're things that you can like argue apply in the moment. So it doesn't have to be perfect because like you know you're spending a currency.  
**Luke Foreman:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** They want you to affect the story basically. Um, so don't feel scared to try to argue your experience applies because you're spend hope to use it anyways.  
**Luke Foreman:** Just like your kind of background  
**John Hagey:** I don't know if that's a good game mechanic or a threat.  
**Luke Foreman:** history.  
**GM or Aggie:** What did you say?  
**John Hagey:** I said I don't know if that's a good game mechanic or a  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** threat.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. And then an advantage roll. Is that that D12 or is that just  
**John Hagey:** And the hardest part about being TDI is figuring out where to put all the f\*\*\*\*\*\* screens on this  
   
 

### 00:31:11

   
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** screen.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. So it's worth noting that advantage is a d6. I'll add that to this. Um so like instead of you add or subtract a  
**Luke Foreman:** I just added these  
**GM or Aggie:** d6.  
**John Hagey:** Oh yeah, we've done something like that before.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** in D and D a lot of times that's what people do will do for inspiration I  
**GM or Aggie:** I like that.  
**Luke Foreman:** guess like B inspiration kind of thing at a D6 or  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah,  
**Luke Foreman:** whatever.  
**GM or Aggie:** when you do the math, I guess it kind of comes out that way,  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** huh? Um Does anyone have questions about their characters or anything? John, I have um there's probably some things with ash bloods that I you would probably know that we haven't really talked about. things like there's probably a hundred to 200 that are at Vindilla right now or in the city which you're uh how many do you have and when are you gonna set off the you're so weird you know  
   
 

### 00:32:46

   
**John Hagey:** I'm giving you I don't know what you're talking  
**GM or Aggie:** no one's  
**John Hagey:** about.  
**GM or Aggie:** fire eater um there's probably a hundred or 200 Ashb Bloods Evan. So the question would be how social is Ignatius? Because we've talked about like his politics and how where he'd be at politics, meaning he's not blind, but like does he have any um and and we can we can do this like a character building later if you want, but things like does he have any friends in his clan or does he have any um anybody else? because probably almost all the youths or like the the really the young people would be going to school this year. Um because the Ashwoods have leaned into Harmony pretty um pretty forward forward lean into harmony. So you  
**John Hagey:** Yeah, I yeah, we can we'll build into it later, but I can definitely see like Ignatius like sure he kind of,  
**GM or Aggie:** would  
**John Hagey:** you know, has that rebellious side to him, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have friends and, you know, like keep it's not like he he's not an antisocial person by any means.  
   
 

### 00:33:57

   
**GM or Aggie:** Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna give you a journal that just has like here's a bunch of Ashb Blood NPCs and you can decide if you want to pull them in to the  
**John Hagey:** Cool.  
**GM or Aggie:** session.  
**John Hagey:** I'm just gonna randomly pick a name at the most inappropriate time and be like, "There's that guy I know from  
**GM or Aggie:** What's up,  
**John Hagey:** the  
**GM or Aggie:** Johnny?  
**John Hagey:** Yes, that's Johnny Smokes.  
**Luke Foreman:** Johnny Johnny Smokes.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, okay. Um, Lomi probably the same thing at least for like um the under the like the mechanics outside of class. There's definitely a few that you would know at Harmony. Um, so I' I've seen some people make a like uh make it the players responsibility to pull in people from their backstory as they see fit, which is kind of an interesting idea. And then they basically like DM the retcon. Um, so we can decide if we want to do that or not later, but um Okay. Uh, did y'all listen to the I know Luke listened to the thing.  
   
 

### 00:35:38

   
**GM or Aggie:** Did you listen to the I read the thing? I didn't listen. You read it. Didn't listen. Did you listen to the recap, John? All right. Go read the recap.  
**Luke Foreman:** It was like it was kind of less of a recap than it was like a lead into this.  
**John Hagey:** Wait,  
**Luke Foreman:** What's going on  
**John Hagey:** hold on.  
**Luke Foreman:** next?  
**John Hagey:** I actually took notes last time because there was the Sarah Fox preppy girl.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** There's Lady Ignis. She was the military general sort of from uh from the island. So that's kind of like, you know, the the top tier sort of uh influence of uh of the Ash Bloods and stuff for for adventuring, all that other good stuff. Let's see here. The adventure woman captain Thorne found the Ashlin Islands. Yes. Yes. That's that's pretty much all I got.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Um,  
**John Hagey:** I I also said we we climbed  
**GM or Aggie:** we climbed.  
   
 

### 00:36:36

   
**GM or Aggie:** Yes, we did climb climb tall crane. Um, so yeah, the I mean, you can just I guess I could read it out loud. Um but uh sorry I'm trying to give you your list of of uh Ash Blood folks that I have to strip out stuff on their character feed.  
**John Hagey:** Oh, I keep looking at the journal entries. I was like, where is it?  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah,  
**John Hagey:** All right. Well, while you do that, I'll read it real quick since everyone else already I'll speed read  
**GM or Aggie:** perfect.  
**John Hagey:** it.  
**Luke Foreman:** It also made it made me feel kind of, you know, I thought I was kind of special, but what like twothirds get in, right? Isn't that what the math kind of was?  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Yeah. Or more like three,  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** fourth get in.  
**Luke Foreman:** Three4s get in. I was like, "Oh,  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** Not especially yet. Still a lot of people. But when you hear 22,000 people and they don't don't make it in, then it's like, oh, uh, okay.  
   
 

### 00:38:11

   
**Luke Foreman:** That's true.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** That's true.  
**John Hagey:** They have tapped a keg of something called engine grease.  
**GM or Aggie:** This is this is worth I mean it's it's nice that like um generating the speech is not the hard part. Like once you make the transcript, it's pretty easy to have him read it. But I was curious. I was curious what you were gonna say about the voice this time versus the other voices.  
**Luke Foreman:** I liked it.  
**GM or Aggie:** I just opened the for one of the flights so I could read it in flight. Okay.  
**John Hagey:** All right, I'm done.  
**GM or Aggie:** Nice.  
**John Hagey:** This is pretty good.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Um, maybe it's hard to remember. Should I risk it or should I re make sure that you're not getting any anything you shouldn't be getting?  
**John Hagey:** I mean, what are the odds I get that far in the reading  
**GM or Aggie:** No,  
**John Hagey:** anyway?  
**GM or Aggie:** that's fair. Well, I mean, if I give you a journal handle, I know that you'll read the whole thing because that one time we were playing the other campaign, you read every single beast in the beastiary when I accidentally revealed  
   
 

### 00:39:51

   
**John Hagey:** Yes, send it to me. Don't even Don't even just send it.  
**GM or Aggie:** them.  
**John Hagey:** Just don't even read it. Just send it. Send the whole thing. There's no way I can manipulate this in a bad way.  
**Luke Foreman:** No way at  
**GM or Aggie:** Not suspicious at all.  
**John Hagey:** Zero.  
**Luke Foreman:** all.  
**GM or Aggie:** I would and I wouldn't even if I could, you know. No. Yeah, it's it's all it's all it's all jacked. You're just getting names.  
**John Hagey:** A  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Um, so as you have heard from um, Mr. Mr. Sterling, the night of the first day of school is upon you. And where we left off last time was was right about when when the um when I think Lomi was going to come over was coming over to perhaps approach a a problem with a solution. And um at the same time, Ignatius was watching Iggy climb a crane. Aggie and Britt were judging both of them and judge and judging even more harshly Sarah Sarah Fox um who had come by and um and then before that, zooming back even further, there was a whole bunch of people at this very large campus and um you made your way through the intake exams and found yourself assigned dorms in your initial rankings and um and yeah and then so kind of like the the campus was your place to explore for the next day before you had to go to class the following morning.  
   
 

### 00:43:33

   
**GM or Aggie:** And um I mean you can see like there's as as you were told on the radio there's sort of two events that people end up doing on the first day of class. Whether that's tradition or just what's happening that's that's kind of um where these 70,000 people have have crammed their way into this repurposed expedition city. Um one of which is seems to be bonfires. There's a lot of people finding old construction trash or um places where the grass hasn't quite set in yet. And you can see that there's there's quite a few clusters of bonfires coming up across this sprawling courtyard um which I can activate for yall now just so that you have um a visual. So you've got um this main hall which is which is where you had your um dean assaldi came and spoke to you about what or give you your welcome to Bumbua. You have the large courtyard behind it. Um there's a chunk of dorms and classrooms built behind. And then there's also classrooms and and dorms along the main island classroom of the sky spires and the deep hole.  
   
 

### 00:44:56

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um there's also all sorts of airships and and ship ships zooming all around Vimua at all hours. Um, and you also can see, so yeah, so in this in this main courtyard there is the the little one bonfire, but that's not the only one. There are several others all around you. And um, the second thing that you know is happening is over in like the sort of rich area of town. Some of these uh fancy places are holding essentially receptions for those who are from a more sophisticated lineage. Um and you know looking around there is a a lot of a lot of just different peoples here. you can see that there is um like a a huge hodge podge of civilization and um and there's like some people seem to sort of be trying to fit the clan fashion which um of the Ashb Bloods you see that there there's not been a whole lot that you've noticed but there you like 200 out of 70,000 is at least enough that you can maybe pick out one or two if you're really paying attention but there's so distinctive about Ash Blood clothing that would make them stand out like tremendously in a crowd besides um I think even Ignatius said earlier that he's he might be currently dirty but it's more from his travels than from his state of being.  
   
 

### 00:46:29

   
**GM or Aggie:** So um the I just kind of imagine y'all mostly wear black because you know ash and so it's easier to get out than um particularly colorful clothing. So,  
**John Hagey:** Yep.  
**GM or Aggie:** um yeah, we'll we'll kind of pick up right where we left off with um Lomi approaching the group of you. Um Iggy's still up in the crane and um and Sarah, Aggie, Brit, and Ignatius are at the bottom of the actually just dropped down like superhero landing and did his little explosive poof. Uh, so yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** Was  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh, Lomi, what what what is um what's your kind of angle coming into the group? I don't know that y'all really have that tight of of connection yet that you can call it a favor, but  
**Luke Foreman:** this this was around the bonfire or I came from the bonfire  
**GM or Aggie:** you came from the Yeah. Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** to  
**GM or Aggie:** So, to walk you back just a couple more steps, the um when you were at the bonfire, you could tell that the the one that you had just meandered towards had someone had put a lot of effort into it.  
   
 

### 00:47:36

   
**GM or Aggie:** It was the one that was outside like that industrial building which just happened to be you know the closest one that all of y'all h were near. Um there was this very symmetrical log arrangement and you could see there was like this nervous looking guy just fuss always fussing out taking notes drawing like diagrams about the fire and um and then that's when he said like I perfect I just I need a spark. I don't I don't I don't it's ready for the flame but I don't know what Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** Oh, that's right. Yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** And you had said,  
**Luke Foreman:** that's Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** "I I can fix that.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah. All right. Lumi walks over and to the group and um Ignatius was a part of the the group with Lucky right in the  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** Ignatius was there in that stands when  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** Hey,  
**John Hagey:** So,  
**Luke Foreman:** Ignatius. Good to see you again. Uh, they could use a little a little help over at the fire.  
   
 

### 00:48:35

   
**Luke Foreman:** I think they I I don't mean to insinuate anything, but I think you could you could get a fire going if you needed to.  
**John Hagey:** let me get this straight. You think that just because I come from the Ash Blood Islands that you can just come over here and ask me for a light whenever you need it? You're not wrong, but that's not the  
**Luke Foreman:** I I mean,  
**John Hagey:** point.  
**Luke Foreman:** I wasn't insinuating you had to do it. I could take a little, you know, scrap of paper here and and maybe give you a  
**John Hagey:** Well, honestly,  
**Luke Foreman:** handshake.  
**John Hagey:** I'm glad you trust me so much right away.  
**Luke Foreman:** It It just There's just something about you that makes it makes it seem like you'd be good starting the fire. I don't know.  
**John Hagey:** Uh, Ignatius is like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely." Just I guess he takes the the scrap of paper and walks over with me over to the fire and just you uh you need a little hand here or  
   
 

### 00:49:33

   
**GM or Aggie:** Okay.  
**Luke Foreman:** I think we uh just take the paper and and like either hand it to the  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh,  
**Luke Foreman:** person or this lit piece of paper just kind of like toss it in like it's not try try to keep it casual. You know, you got a new kid on campus got to look pretty cool just lighting up this fire.  
**GM or Aggie:** okay. So you're just gonna you're just going to stroll your way over and you got the kid who got he he's been he's you know respectable respectled tinkering with the fire and then all of a sudden just a flame erupts in front of his face. It's like no it was not that I was the fire had to come from this side. What is this? And he just starts starts panicking and then he just gets real quiet and he's like, "Oh, it is on fire." But then this is very nonoptimal. Who? Who? And he like leans around the fire and looks at you. Lomi says, "Explain yourself, please. Why have you done  
   
 

### 00:50:31

   
**Luke Foreman:** In my experience,  
**GM or Aggie:** this?  
**Luke Foreman:** it uh down in the boiler room, I just, you know, moments that there's not that the fire's not running, that's that's costing you money. that's cost. You know, time is money. You got to focus on uptime, whether it's perfect or not. You know, perfect is the enemy of good. We got to we got to get this thing running and make sure make sure we got a good fire  
**GM or Aggie:** Um,  
**Luke Foreman:** going.  
**GM or Aggie:** this is an interesting proposal. I will consider this. No, no, you're not. You're not. You're not. I will consider this. It was effective, but it is not always true that momentum is life. though with the radio always says it. Uh I don't have to and he just kind of like starts pitter powdering away. And then um you also like I don't know if uh so did as Ignatius came over did Aggie and Brit follow? I think Aggie's curious but also doesn't want to get too close.  
   
 

### 00:51:36

   
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Okay.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** That's a good little interesting.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I think the same I agreed.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I think fire is a is a interesting thing for us.  
**GM or Aggie:** Mhm. Got it.  
**John Hagey:** On one hand,  
**GM or Aggie:** Um,  
**John Hagey:** it consumes a lot of things and kills and things. On the other hand, you're like a mushroom.  
**GM or Aggie:** okay. In that case, uh,  
**John Hagey:** So,  
**GM or Aggie:** I think Sarah Sarah would have stayed out there with y'all. It was kind of lingering, but we'll come back. I just wanted to know if she was there or not. Um so there's um as Casius where he and I think he said oh um well I I do have to say that you have accomplished a mission so um that is worth a name. Hello I am Casius and he reaches out his hand towards  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, Lomi.  
**GM or Aggie:** you.  
**Luke Foreman:** Nice to meet you down uh work. I worked in the boiler room a number of years down, you know, it's it's nice to be a top side.  
   
 

### 00:52:29

   
**Luke Foreman:** See what you guys do up here. It's um it's impressive. I will say it's impressive. I assume you're uh how technical you are. I assume you're you're something uh something to do with the buildings as well. So, good work.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um no I am a student here. I have not had anything that is a very good compliment. It is um it is a majestic. No watching all of these come to  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, it is. I I just,  
**GM or Aggie:** life.  
**Luke Foreman:** you know, you did something right to be in charge of starting the bonfire. So, hey, good good on you.  
**GM or Aggie:** Oh he he kind of um he gets a little embarrassed maybe. Do you want to you want to try? Uh yeah, you want to try and roll with Yeah,  
**Luke Foreman:** I  
**John Hagey:** We're rolling. We're going to roll. We're going to roll  
**GM or Aggie:** we're going to roll roll with dice because this is I'm gonna say instinct.  
   
 

### 00:53:17

   
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Huh?  
**John Hagey:** something.  
**GM or Aggie:** So you got plus one to  
**Luke Foreman:** do. I do have plus one instincts.  
**GM or Aggie:** instinct.  
**Luke Foreman:** I will roll. That's a crit. That's a crit though,  
**GM or Aggie:** That is a crit. That is a crit.  
**John Hagey:** Nice. Nice.  
**GM or Aggie:** Huge.  
**Luke Foreman:** right?  
**GM or Aggie:** That's a good call.  
**John Hagey:** I forgot that's what crits were in this  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Um, okay.  
**John Hagey:** game.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. So, with with that crit, one thing that you notice as he's talking is his eyes flick over to Sarah and his cheeks get a little bit rosy and he says, "Um, yes, I am um I have to admit I was not um planning to come here tonight, but I I just felt like this was um the place to be." No, this was the place to be.  
**Luke Foreman:** I think clocking clock him clocking that he's just gonna go, "Well, man, I I just don't I just don't see how we would have done it without you.  
   
 

### 00:54:07

   
**John Hagey:** Listen.  
**Luke Foreman:** You did a great job and this fire is beautiful." So, and it it Lomi gets a little bit louder as he's saying this. Like, you you just did such a great job, you know? I hear.  
**GM or Aggie:** Oh,  
**Luke Foreman:** And like gives him gives him a hand to like pull pull him up out of the out of the fire so he can  
**GM or Aggie:** too much.  
**Luke Foreman:** pat him on the  
**GM or Aggie:** Just like stumbles forward a few steps and and like towards the fire.  
**Luke Foreman:** back.  
**GM or Aggie:** It's like, oh, um, amazing. And and yeah, so Ignatius, while while Lomi is kind of chatting up, Casius, are you are you hanging out too? Are you all are you wondering because there's there's a couple of other things that are happening outside of this one fire pit that depending on where your focus is.  
**John Hagey:** Uh, I think Ignatius is going to wander a little  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Um, so we'll come back there. But first,  
**John Hagey:** bit.  
**GM or Aggie:** Brit and Aggie, as you're watching um watching the the the guys walk over this um small spark becomes a quite quite impressive bonfire rather quickly.  
   
 

### 00:55:17

   
**GM or Aggie:** It was it was pretty well seated. Um he Cassie may or may not have cheated. You'll never know.  
**Luke Foreman:** What's  
**GM or Aggie:** But it it went up it went up pretty quick. And and the as you've been walking,  
**Luke Foreman:** happen?  
**GM or Aggie:** Sarah has been there next to you and she's like really she keeps turning and opening her mouth and then like she closes it and walks forward a little bit and then she'll she like do she's really really having uh struggles. Yeah. She's um I'll just kind of ride off of that earlier that earlier crip from Lo me that y'all getting a good the good lowdown of the people around you, but she she clearly just wants to interrogate the s\*\*\* out of y'all, but she is trying really hard to like let you lead the conversation. Um and so that's that's kind of just the vibe you're getting from her as y'all start walking your way over from the crane. We found out last time she's an applicant, right? Not she's a candidate.  
   
 

### 00:56:19

   
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah, she's correct. Correct. She's the same as y'all.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Uh, are you Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** Oh my god. Uh, is it that obvious? I didn't really mean for it to be. I just really was so curious about everything. And I mean, we're just here in this like the most important anthropological cauldron in years. I mean, I'm just very excited. Um, what if do you have questions about anything? Um, oh, where are you from? Oh, um, I'm from, uh, the far east side of the main continent. Uh, do you know anything about the continent yet? Sorry if that's rude. Just like panicked every time she assumes something. Um we've seen maps and stuff, right? Yeah. Um we wouldn't really know a whole lot. I I kind of feel like that's up to you. Especially the Mizi haven't haven't been like the core of the forest hasn't really had a lot of traffic. There's been mostly like weapons coming less instruction and material education.  
   
 

### 00:57:32

   
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. And education. Um mostly because like your elders haven't asked for any of that stuff. Not because there it seems like and and there might be even some undercurrens like shouldn't we learn from them and that that's why y'all are here at the at the academy.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Hm. Where do most of the students come from?  
**GM or Aggie:** Oh, all over. I um well the and um and maybe she just kind of gives you like a little bit of a description of of the the world which um  
**John Hagey:** Hey, look. It's me home.  
**GM or Aggie:** she points to and she says, "Well, um, of course there's the seat of Harmony. It's it's the biggest city in well, Harmony. Uh, it's huge. I think there's probably I don't know 8 million people that live there. Um, honestly, it's a little big for my taste. I have um my my um my family has been there a time or two before. There's also some of the the key spots of where the academy has been over the course of Harmony's history.  
   
 

### 00:58:36

   
**GM or Aggie:** There's I've been always part of civilization. It's why it's so exciting to be here to see what the great new cities being founded. Um, hi Ignatius is your name. I think this is the uh  
**John Hagey:** Who's talking right now?  
**GM or Aggie:** Sarah.  
**John Hagey:** This is S.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah,  
**John Hagey:** Why did your voice change so much from what she was talking before to this? I thought it was a completely different  
**GM or Aggie:** he's trying to be British, but she's not all the way quite there.  
**John Hagey:** character.  
**GM or Aggie:** And she's very excited.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** You don't you don't know her culture.  
**John Hagey:** I I perked up because I was like,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Stop culture shaming her,  
**John Hagey:** "New voice,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** John.  
**John Hagey:** new character. What's going  
**GM or Aggie:** Um,  
**John Hagey:** on?  
**GM or Aggie:** I I didn't really get to say a whole lot before now, so I'm still settling in.  
**Luke Foreman:** Fair point. Fair point.  
**GM or Aggie:** Maybe like a flourish.  
**John Hagey:** Oh god.  
**GM or Aggie:** I don't  
   
 

### 00:59:23

   
**John Hagey:** Uh, sorry.  
**GM or Aggie:** know.  
**John Hagey:** Excuse me. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, yeah. My name's And is Ignasia just like background right now? Like it's kind of what I was expecting.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. I mean, because you said you were wandering if you just kind of turned around to see where they were at,  
**John Hagey:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** that that would have been about the right amount of time between um and  
**John Hagey:** Okay. Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** yeah, she she kind of talks through some of the the big cities and she's um and maybe she's even just drawn this map in her notebook that she's carrying around with you so you kind of get an idea of the sprawl. Um but oh gosh there's there's so much that I could talk about here talk about here in in in harmony and it's well there's the people there's the like the big factions um what's interesting to you do you have anything that you'd really well oh yes where I'm from um and I guess I'm mostly from Septin the north side in the sort of the eastern side of the continent like I said I spent I've unfortunately had to spend quite a lot of time in the seat um in the sea.  
   
 

### 01:00:22

   
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Why do you say that's unfortunate?  
**GM or Aggie:** This is the capital.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Why is that an unfortunate thing?  
**GM or Aggie:** I don't really like big um um there's a lot of political pressure there and it's uh can be quite heavy on on you and I  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** M.  
**GM or Aggie:** I liked it more when I was out in the you know the smaller cities where there was less less um like money really. Why have you had to spend so much time there? Oh, you know, everyone finds a reason to be there at some point or another.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** H.B.  
**GM or Aggie:** If you want to roll, uh, she she's maybe Yeah. I mean, so she's she can tell she's holding back. Thanks. I wasn't able to edit my things before. Oh. Um, yeah. So, you have a plus two, two plus ones, and one got it. Um, so you can you can roll to like how do you how do you want to approach her because she's she's clearly not telling everything.  
   
 

### 01:01:32

   
**GM or Aggie:** She has something that she's holding back about her experience. So like you could try to charm her into being more I think that's more the approach that she wants to take like kind of uh I think that at least Aggie thinks that she knows at least a lot of like the political stuff between the different areas. So she kind of wants to befriend her so she has like a continuous source of information. Okay. Um knowledge is one. What did I mess up? Your instinct is two. Okay. Uh so that's that sounding a little bit like a um like a presence role. A charming a charm role. Um, yeah, I guess so.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Come  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. So, let's go ahead and get that four with hope. Okay. So,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** on.  
**GM or Aggie:** you don't get the result that you or 07 with fear. Okay. Yeah. So, that's kind of like the kind of worse of both.  
   
 

### 01:02:42

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um, so she she just I think um she just kind of shuts down a little bit and she it's just a lot there. But um oh look the fire is did did we put this up? And she she kind of like jogs forward and um as Lomi is hyping up Cas comes over. Casius, did you do this? He's like, yes, with some help from um Ignatius and from uh  
**John Hagey:** No, he pretty much did it all by himself.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** Lomi.  
**Luke Foreman:** we we couldn't have done it.  
**John Hagey:** Match fire.  
**Luke Foreman:** We couldn't have done it ourselves. No way.  
**GM or Aggie:** Oh, guys,  
**John Hagey:** Great.  
**GM or Aggie:** please stop. That's too much. I know. I can't I can't somewhere in that that area.  
**Luke Foreman:** Flirt with yourself.  
**GM or Aggie:** Depending on their  
**Luke Foreman:** Flirt with yourself.  
**John Hagey:** You have to do it.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um,  
**John Hagey:** We set it up.  
**GM or Aggie:** I can't speak in that many voices right now.  
**John Hagey:** Not with that attitude.  
   
 

### 01:03:41

   
**GM or Aggie:** Uh, and she Okay,  
**John Hagey:** Look,  
**GM or Aggie:** fine.  
**John Hagey:** all you have to do you you had two voices there.  
**GM or Aggie:** So,  
**John Hagey:** You had a British voice and you had an Indian voice. Just stick with those. Yeah. You started to you started to you were trying to keep it still you were trying to still keep it English but you kind of drawn off to  
**GM or Aggie:** no.  
**John Hagey:** a deeper voice. You you had an Indian an Indian accent there for a second.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Nope. You It's Nordic though.  
**John Hagey:** I believe in you. Two voices.  
**GM or Aggie:** They're very similar.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** What's  
**John Hagey:** It's only two Luke. All you got to do is two  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh,  
**John Hagey:** voices.  
**GM or Aggie:** so I think Yeah. So, Casius and I they don't they don't talk that long because they're not that close. But,  
**John Hagey:** Let me lo wing man.  
**GM or Aggie:** um Sarah's gonna go I  
**John Hagey:** Damn it.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay, then with that that crit that you saw earlier, I think that you get really you see that Cassie is like kind of sad that he didn't get more of a reaction from Sarah um when y'all hyped him up.  
   
 

### 01:04:30

   
**John Hagey:** I'm  
**GM or Aggie:** But she she just kind of went over and she's still sitting nearby, but uh she's now um kind of not as active and not trying to uh ask a bunch of questions, but you can tell she's just like she's trying to think through something. Um she's clearly uh hasn't quite figured out how who she wants to be yet. Um which makes sense because how  
**John Hagey:** gonna I'm gonna elbow I'm gonna elbow Cassie as be like, "Hey, I overheard her. She's into anthropology, so I think she likes ants." Well,  
**GM or Aggie:** that is not what that means.  
**John Hagey:** that's what she's interested  
**GM or Aggie:** Um,  
**John Hagey:** in.  
**GM or Aggie:** I think I got the word right. Thank you. Something kind of helpful, I think.  
**John Hagey:** Cool. Go start a conversation.  
**GM or Aggie:** I think the sorry  
**John Hagey:** Go on.  
**GM or Aggie:** uh  
**John Hagey:** Come on, Loy. You think you can do it,  
**GM or Aggie:** ants but  
**John Hagey:** right?  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, of course he's got it. He's Hey.  
   
 

### 01:05:34

   
**Luke Foreman:** Hey, there's a spark between  
**GM or Aggie:** um oh god is there and he's  
**Luke Foreman:** you.  
**GM or Aggie:** like checking like I knew you had to press me close to the fire but I did not think I had sparks.  
**John Hagey:** What?  
**Luke Foreman:** You're all right. You're all right, kid.  
**GM or Aggie:** I I don't um I don't think thank and he goes to sit on the far side of the like log from where Sarah is. And uh as they they kind of sit down, you you get a chance to look around the the rest of the immediate area. And you can see there's kind of like a couple of things happening. There is just off to the corner there. There's like an argument that's kind of breaking out between um like a well-dressed guy, a uh a war forged guy, some something that looks like half plant and um and a a girl with like platinum blonde hair. And they they sort of you can't quite hear what's going on because there is still a lot of people moving in and around you.  
   
 

### 01:06:43

   
**GM or Aggie:** There's some people that are just stopping and looking at the fire before clearing off. Some people are are sitting and and talking by it. And that's one of those groups. There's also um you can just pick out the the distinctive voice of um lucky that's coming from somewhere in the in the crowd off to the side.  
**Luke Foreman:** It just goes throughout.  
**GM or Aggie:** And yeah, it's it's staying in the same area. He he you can like if you if you went to look you would see um eventually as the the cloud  
**John Hagey:** I'm  
**GM or Aggie:** parses you see Lucky standing on a small little box and he's got this like uh satchel and he's pulling things out of it and uh gesturing to people as they come by. You can also  
**John Hagey:** g stop you right there.  
**GM or Aggie:** um  
**John Hagey:** Ignatius is definitely interested in the the the commotion of the  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Okay. Yeah. And then there's Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** argument.  
**GM or Aggie:** Then there's like there's a crowd that's moving off campus to go to the the other parties and stuff that are more they're dressed more formally.  
   
 

### 01:07:42

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um Okay. So So he's headed towards the uh the argument. What about what about  
**John Hagey:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** Lomi?  
**John Hagey:** Hey, Lomi.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah,  
**John Hagey:** You listening to this?  
**Luke Foreman:** I think Lomi is into it.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. So as I'll go What about Britain and Aggie? Are they I think she's at least Aggie's confused when Sarah runs off and she's just like, "Did did I say something?"  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** You didn't say anything to me. I don't know. I I do think I I think I'm also drawn to the argument though.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Like I think I I see it like I feel like that they clock it and so we clock it that they're clocking it or something like I don't know. I think my eye is drawn there too.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Okay. Cool. Um and and and there's like there's a lot of other things around campus too that y'all could go explore if you wanted to, but this is is kind of the immediate area.  
   
 

### 01:08:47

   
**GM or Aggie:** So just like if you if you feel like your character might be looking for something like think think of your your first day of arrival at a college campus. There's just so much going on that is your character the type of person that just like sticks with a  
**John Hagey:** How would you know?  
**GM or Aggie:** couple of things and rides the current or do they go and like immediately try to meet everything and do everything at once or try to experience all the new stuff. So, those are some options. But, as you all get pulled into this argument near the fire fire, there's this um there's this uh guy in a I mean, he's he's he's well dressed in like the sort of classic Bridgetgerton outfit. He looks like he he might have just come to the party or come from the party. Um, and he's you just hear him say, "Listen, listen. I'll wager 50 sovereigns that there's an Earth clan underground theory." The theories that they say that there must be one. There's We've got two. There's got to be like four more at least.  
   
 

### 01:09:48

   
**GM or Aggie:** And some other guys like, man, that s\*\*\*'s nonsense. We found Ash Blood and Maze. That's probably all there is. We're lucky to find these two. And he says, "But the symmetry." Listen, listen. No. We've got plants. We have fire. There's going to be water. There's going to be earth, there's going to be air, there it's got to be all sorts of other ones, right? Like and and so you can tell that this argument is is of just pulling theories from different explorations in the history of harmony and trying to guess of like which nodes have not yet been found and what would they be? Uh and uh so as that he's like I mean there's you kind of come into like those last couple lines he's like but I mean it just it has to be a full complete and then um a third guy comes in and says or the the plant looking person says what if uh they are not the missing what if we are the ones who forgot and the platinum girl's like or maybe the world is just broken not Everything needs to be a pattern.  
   
 

### 01:10:55

   
**GM or Aggie:** And the fancy guy's like, "Mark my words. When we find the missing clans, I'll be vindicated. The theories will be true." And that's kind of like where y'all enter the conversation. Are you just going to let it ride out? Are you listening? Or are you going to throw  
**John Hagey:** I think as soon as I hear the topic of this,  
**GM or Aggie:** in  
**John Hagey:** he loses all interest. Like immediately he's just like, "All right, whatever.  
**Luke Foreman:** How I How plugged in is Lomi to like distant his distant history as like with some Earth King in his past.  
**GM or Aggie:** I think that, you know, Earthkin's a pretty like not an uncommon race. So there wouldn't be like a genetic tie to the first Earth King of Harmony, for example. But I think that you would have some tie into like the world as a whole or just,  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** you know, you'd be smarter than most at identifying interesting things about the world. What What are you trying to What are you trying to learn?  
   
 

### 01:12:02

   
**Luke Foreman:** I just like if he would be like aware of his like Earthkin past and that there likely is still Earthkin or like I guess like and I guess this is also probably up to me as well, but uh of like if he believes there's still Earthkin out there. Um and and like what that would mean for his his sort of history,  
**John Hagey:** So  
**Luke Foreman:** I guess.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Yeah. Like the the Earth itself I I think is still a common enough race. Like Harmony has, you know,  
**John Hagey:** they're talking about like a sub race of Earth can that like subterrally live like they're not just like earth people.  
**GM or Aggie:** enough  
**John Hagey:** They're like people who live under the earth and like a hollow earth theory sort of deal.  
**Luke Foreman:** or like Iggy.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** Like they were talking about they were talking about a potential species that lives underneath the earth.  
**GM or Aggie:** Like  
**John Hagey:** Like they weren't talking about Earthkin because it's common enough, but maybe a subspecies of Earthkin are something that lives under the Earth because like obviously they agree like  
   
 

### 01:13:11

   
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** Earthkin are common enough that it's not like Lomi is going to show up and be like I'm Earthkin and they're going to be like but like okay I was I was also trying to track  
**GM or Aggie:** Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like the race itself is is is enough like other races that it's  
**John Hagey:** that  
**GM or Aggie:** not, you know, pink skin, pink hair, obviously different, but the way they live and some of the other things that make uh like Iggy Iggy, for example, are going to be very different than what makes low me low  
**Luke Foreman:** Gotcha. Okay. Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** meat.  
**Luke Foreman:** I gotcha.  
**John Hagey:** There's  
**Luke Foreman:** I a I I don't mean to butt in too too much here, but being as I am doing some work in the uh  
**John Hagey:** a lot of  
**Luke Foreman:** boiler room, I think uh we've we've got some theories and you know, we hear some things. You know, when we're down there, maybe a bottle is being passed around or something like that, but you know, there's there's noises that happen when we're when we're down there in the boiler room.  
   
 

### 01:14:12

   
**Luke Foreman:** And uh I don't know I like to I like to explore different areas of of being and you know I I like to believe there is a there is a people out there that's uh that's living down there watching us. A a very friendly people I would say. We've never had any issues of things going missing or people going missing or anything like that, but there's stories.  
**GM or Aggie:** That see that's what I'm talking about. And the guy the he reached out and said Percy Van Smice III  
**Luke Foreman:** Lomi, Lomi Sultano.  
**GM or Aggie:** pleasure  
**Luke Foreman:** Uh, it's great to meet you. Been Boiler Maker family from for ages.  
**GM or Aggie:** salt of the earth salt. See these are the type of people that know the I mean that's just that's I mean in the other guy the other one the war forest who I kind of imagine is like a a grown-up clank. He's kind of like, you know, a younger war forge. Still got a lot of a lot of curves on his. He hasn't quite like slimmed out all the way.  
   
 

### 01:15:15

   
**Luke Foreman:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, and he's like,  
**Luke Foreman:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** I mean, what do you even know? You're just working all  
**Luke Foreman:** Hey, sometimes just being there is right place,  
**GM or Aggie:** day.  
**Luke Foreman:** right time situation. And uh when you're down there for for 12 plus hours, it maybe we're a little delirious. I'll give you that. But, uh, we do hear some things. That's all I'll  
**GM or Aggie:** the uh the blondhaired girl runs like sprints over and she says,  
**Luke Foreman:** say.  
**GM or Aggie:** "Either way, what a crap place to live. That would suck. Buried underground, not under the sky. Can't chase the storms. Like, what do you even do?  
**Luke Foreman:** Now, that's something we can agree on right there. I'll tell you, after my shift, I'm out of there. No way.  
**GM or Aggie:** What do you do for fun?  
**Luke Foreman:** What do I do for fun? Hey, I heard there's some some uh some engine oil going around uh around here somewhere. Let's uh let's find out what we do for fun.  
   
 

### 01:16:16

   
**Luke Foreman:** Hey, what do you  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**Luke Foreman:** say?  
**GM or Aggie:** Jack is like, "Grease?" Yes. Yes.  
**John Hagey:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** I I might have a have a guy.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, let's get some over here.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, and uh, the blonde hair girl's like, "Oh, oh, things to drink. I love drinking things. Let's do it." And she's like,  
**Luke Foreman:** Wow.  
**GM or Aggie:** "Okay, what?  
**John Hagey:** Oh,  
**Luke Foreman:** Excited about that.  
**John Hagey:** damn.  
**Luke Foreman:** Slightly problematic.  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh, and Percy gets up and and he strolled his way. He's like, "I got a guy who knows knows where we can find some good stuff." And he's he kind of starts working his way through the crowd towards where Lucky is. And um you can see like that's that's his currently where what his source is. Um,  
**Luke Foreman:** Oh,  
**GM or Aggie:** so yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** fair. Of  
**GM or Aggie:** So you Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** course.  
**GM or Aggie:** So you can either follow him to Lucky or you can wait till he comes back and and and chat with the other people who are still hanging out by the  
   
 

### 01:17:21

   
**Luke Foreman:** I'll go I'll go see what Ly's got.  
**GM or Aggie:** fire.  
**Luke Foreman:** He's got He's probably gota have something good.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. So Percy, let me head over towards Lucky. And um as you get closer, you hear and that's and now you're lucky, too. Man, you're lucky to have found lucky on this apicious night. Is that say that right? Apospiticious. I learned that one yesterday. Okay. Oh. Oh, is that is that my is that Percy? Percy, I bet you're lucky tonight. Percy, what do you need? What do you need? What can Lucky get for you? And Percy's like, easy luck. Easy luck. I'm here for some of that grease, you know. He said, "Oo, I got grease. I can grease your grades. I can grace your livers. Which one do you want? Lucky to grease." And Percy's like, "Well," and but looks at Lomi. He's like, "Um,  
**Luke Foreman:** Then just deliver variety I think is is all good for  
   
 

### 01:18:16

   
**GM or Aggie:** how are your um Okay. All right. Well, why don't uh look, let's have a little chat on the side,  
**Luke Foreman:** us.  
**GM or Aggie:** but let's get the Greeks." says, "Oh, well, you know the rules. You got to get lucky to get some lucky. So, what do you got for me?" And person's like, "Yeah, how about sovereign?" Like, he's like, "Um, for what? One case." Okay. They negotiate back and forth and eventually uh you get this like Lucky goes underneath his uh crate and pulls out um like six really tall like 32 ounce containers and it's just looks like it basically looks like moonshine. It's just in a glass jar and he passes it over like kind of like a milk jar like a milk  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** carrier. Um passes it over to Percy who passes it to you. Why don't you go take that back to the um to the group? I'm having a little little more talking with with with Lucky. And you can see Lucky just like you're going to not regret it.  
   
 

### 01:19:25

   
**GM or Aggie:** Uh and I think like uh there's there's a few other folks that are hanging around Lucky. You even kind of catch Sarge's eye who happens to be leaning up against the wall in the back corner just like  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** uh he just seems to be kind of keeping an eye over Lucky and not really sure exactly what he is but  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** he just he gives you kind of a nod and shakes his head residedly.  
**Luke Foreman:** I'm I'm gonna give him a little like like point to the the case of stuff and like give him a a  
**GM or Aggie:** Um,  
**Luke Foreman:** shrug like is this stuff any good? Like is it is it as good as we used  
**GM or Aggie:** yeah,  
**Luke Foreman:** to?  
**GM or Aggie:** he uh he just kicked you kick his toe and he's got like a two bottles on the  
**Luke Foreman:** Okay. Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** ground.  
**Luke Foreman:** Cool. Cool. Cool.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um, and yeah, so you start working right back,  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** I presume.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
   
 

### 01:20:14

   
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah. Bringing it back.  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh, as Lomi is coming back through the crowd, Aggie and Brit, I think, uh, after a minute, Sarah comes back up and she says, "Hey, so I'm sorry that that's got a little strange. I just, well, I'm still trying. I'm really nervous about tomorrow and I realized I didn't know um I don't know anything sometimes." Anyways, a weird thing to say, I know, but I hope that wasn't too off-putting. No, I'm I'm I'm sorry if I said something. I uh think I know even less. So, well, um I could riddle off all sorts of weird facts about momentum and and the all the things about random s\*\*\* that my father has made me learn over the years, but uh and much what I learned about where we like where we could go next. You know, it's just always about the past and about the current. And um I anyways, I I didn't want to be too biased when I talked about my home, so I decided not to say anything at all.  
   
 

### 01:21:25

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um do you have a good relationship with your home? I mean, I don't I love our forest. It feels weird to be here now, though. What do you think, Brit?  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yeah, this is all a little bit overwhelming. Everything's just very different here.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah, I can imagine. I've I've read some of the initial reports that have come out of the clans like um of the forest and it's very confusing to be honest to me. I don't know what exactly like how um well, I guess I'll try to say it a different way. Every other place that's ever been discovered has a um, for lack of another term, a a purpose, like a reason that it exists. It's very strange that we we don't exactly know what the forest is for other than apparently surviving and living, which is pretty cool. No, no, no. Not just living, also dying. It's all about balance. Uh, because without death, we can't live. Wow. Well, I guess that is true in in Brit.  
   
 

### 01:22:37

   
**GM or Aggie:** It's the one inevitable truth. Um, so uh well, I guess that's true. God, I haven't thought about death so directly before. That's woman. Yeah. I mean, it's it's part of life. It has to be otherwise nothing can live. True. And that's that's kind of a problem there right now. There's there's too much life. I think that's the only place I've heard this the same sentence before a few times and it doesn't make sense to me. It seems like that's a good thing. No.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Death is the way of things. Without death, there can be nothing new.  
**GM or Aggie:** Well, yes. I mean it's kind of like forest via I suppose like um you know it's just not something usually that people like to kind of talk about in so directly. Well really what why not? Well I guess it's sort of to do isn't it? It's I think yeah he's just going to look at Brit like what like this  
   
 

### 01:23:48

   
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yeah, Brit. I think Brit's the same.  
**GM or Aggie:** is crazy.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** So um my well I'm really quite curious like this the death is just part of part of life you share but like you talk is it is it in your stories is it in your like your your nursery tales death. Well sure is isn't it in yours? Yes. Well we disguise them as weird rhymes that children sing and um interesting. Why hide the truth? It's not bad. It leads to more life.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** And why avoid  
**GM or Aggie:** It's Well,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** it?  
**GM or Aggie:** I don't want to die. Do you want to die? Eventually, one day I I  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Everything dies.  
**GM or Aggie:** go  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Maybe that's a fact. But maybe everything that dies someday comes back.  
**GM or Aggie:** maybe I'll come back as a tree or or a flower. I don't know. I like being mushroom for now, though. This is very different.  
   
 

### 01:24:50

   
**GM or Aggie:** I my father's getting a little old and I don't know that he's he would rather talk about anything but death. That's kind of refreshing in a way to hear it spoken so directly about. Do um do you think like do you know anything about the what it takes for a new we call them nodes like new cities civilizations to integrate with harmony? Have you have you learned this yet?  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** No.  
**GM or Aggie:** This is very interesting. For for example, the Ash Bloods, they had um their their uh I don't even know maybe Ignatius can can speak to it more clearly. I think I don't know if you're paying attention to the clans argument anymore or where you are really but if you're hearing um maybe you can explain the energy of of your town but um city civilization because it integrated it quite easily with harmony from what I  
**John Hagey:** Oh yeah, sure.  
**GM or Aggie:** understand  
**John Hagey:** I reach in my pocket and I pull out a literal like one of the small stones. Yeah, I keep this with me.  
   
 

### 01:25:59

   
**GM or Aggie:** and that never burns through your pocket.  
**John Hagey:** No,  
**GM or Aggie:** It's  
**John Hagey:** wait.  
**GM or Aggie:** hot.  
**John Hagey:** You think that we have had years and years of civilization and not design our clothes to withstand the heat materials that we deal with on a day-to-day  
**GM or Aggie:** It's just so I mean we have if you don't  
**John Hagey:** basis?  
**GM or Aggie:** sweat all of our  
**John Hagey:** No, not really.  
**GM or Aggie:** bio stuff is  
**John Hagey:** I mean, like, yeah, I can sweat, but it's not like how you sweat. Like when if we need to release heat, we just like or we just release it through the fire on our bodies. Like it like you use sweat and you have to use the air to like whip the sweat off of you to get rid of the heat in your  
**GM or Aggie:** Sure.  
**John Hagey:** body. We just burn hotter to thermodynamically get rid of the heat and we just transfer the heat into the air.  
**GM or Aggie:** Sure. That does make sense, I suppose. Um, I mean, it's quite logical really.  
   
 

### 01:26:53

   
**GM or Aggie:** And I think at this point, like, uh, you can if you if you were to look over at Cassie, she's like frantically taking notes and then you just hear like scratching on the the  
**John Hagey:** Yeah. Like,  
**GM or Aggie:** paper.  
**John Hagey:** huh? I guess I sometimes forget that not everyone's like from around here and Yeah, I guess that makes sense. No, but yeah, the the the rocks here like the it's not it's not like the crystals like the it really only provides heat energy, right? We can use it to cook to boil but you know you can use that to power other things but it's not it's not quite the same as the the crystals that came from the seed of harmony came from harmony. So but they do provide you know novelty and they provide the heat that harmony needs and we're not even 100% sure about our own like cause of what causes the heat. We do know that when harmony found us all the all of our heat started to pick up heat. We actually thought we were going to go through a great cooling period.  
   
 

### 01:27:51

   
**John Hagey:** But uh but yeah, it's you know it's with the with our with Harmony's discovery of the our islands like the heat picked back up. So kind of trying to figure that whole thing out.  
**GM or Aggie:** And um I've I've heard before that there's been some contention between well not I don't want to change the topic too quickly but the I guess we don't know what the maze version of that is.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Well, what did what did your clan gain from working with Harmony?  
**GM or Aggie:** It was easy.  
**John Hagey:** the  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Why?  
**John Hagey:** great question. Um uh h well one we  
**Luke Foreman:** Yes.  
**GM or Aggie:** Well,  
**John Hagey:** trade now like these rocks for the energy crystals which allow for different uses of power. We also so do do you know who Lady Ignis is? Do you know the history? Okay. All right. All right. Stand by. All right.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** No,  
**John Hagey:** Stand by. So, first off, there was Captain Allar Thorne, who was the one who found us, right?  
   
 

### 01:29:01

   
**John Hagey:** And then our first, I guess what you would call like great adventurer or explorer was, and I hope I'm getting this right, was Lady Ignis. Sorry, when I said that, that was out of character. I'm hoping John gets this right in character. Was Lady Ignis, who kind of,  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** you know, is one of the best adventurers ever. So, I guess you could see that it it got us a seat at harmony.  
**GM or Aggie:** Almost.  
**John Hagey:** at the scene of harmony,  
**GM or Aggie:** Like Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** but also  
**GM or Aggie:** Ignis was an explorer.  
**John Hagey:** Huh.  
**GM or Aggie:** No. No. Ash Bloods were were explorers. Ignis was the matriarch of the clan who went with Allara Thorne, who was the explorer who defound the Ash Bloods, back to the Seed of Harmony,  
**John Hagey:** ah retcon everything he just  
**GM or Aggie:** which is what you're talking about right now. And  
**John Hagey:** said. Uh yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** yeah.  
**John Hagey:** So our lady So our lady Ignis now I guess I would guess you would say is a prominent member of Harmony and we have depending on who you ask we have a a solid relationship with Harmony when it comes to trade and stuff.  
   
 

### 01:30:03

   
**John Hagey:** My own personal thoughts. My own personal thoughts is I'm not 100% sure that our relationship is beneficial to both sides  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Oh, I think Brit makes like serious eye contact with Aggie.  
**John Hagey:** yet.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Like,  
**John Hagey:** You okay there? Uh, you seem to be  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yep. Fine. Fine.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah, you mentioned Lady Ignis. Um,  
**John Hagey:** uh  
**GM or Aggie:** she's incredible, by the way. Uh I'm And now she's the the current well we don't really have a title for it but she holds the most like you know she holds the the highest voting power on all of harmony right now. This is um part of integrating into harmony is that the newest member holds the highest voting power in the seat. So she's a kind of like the president now.  
**John Hagey:** How does that work exactly?  
**GM or Aggie:** Well, we um we are kind of a people of extremes sometimes and I think this was maybe a bit of an overcorrection, but we harmony. Um, no I there's there's a lot wrong with harmony but one thing that when we do miss we try to I keep saying we I don't know that I want to say we but harmony always misses in the way to make the people who want to join the most interested  
   
 

### 01:31:37

   
**GM or Aggie:** possible. And in the past things like making them a minority or not giving them enough power have created strife later on. And when it comes to exploration or usage of the resources of the new lands, it should not be someone who hasn't lived there giving those decisions. So instead after a period what part of integration seems to be something about the land of the nodes, understanding not just the the powers but the people that live there. And it's become the our historical pattern that a new civilization should be given the most power because the least of us should become the most of us. And and oftent times clans try to give them all of this help and and and sometimes they can rule them as puppets almost because they're so ignorant for this type of global management of a city and and show their tricks. Long story short, we would rather give the clans too much power than not enough has been the place that or the the newest member of harmony. And that's worked the last few times pretty well like over the last thousand years.  
   
 

### 01:32:52

   
**GM or Aggie:** We haven't had a a new integration of whale. And most attribute it to making I mean it is literally I mean the scholars say it's it is life. It is how how harmony was formed. It's why the continents pull closer together. It's this intrinsic energy that links us all. And if we don't invest into it, it will cause much strife later on. And I think um as the conversation is sort of weaving a little bit with the other groups who's who's kind of chimed down um Percy at this point comes back and walks into the group he's like and that is why I say there have to be more clans. See, it makes sense because if there isn't more, then what is all this other land for? You know,  
**John Hagey:** What was that last part you said really  
**GM or Aggie:** and being like,  
**John Hagey:** fast?  
**GM or Aggie:** "Oh, oh my god, are you holy s\*\*\*? You guys are um first of all, great to meet you." And he was squawking towards uh I don't know.  
   
 

### 01:33:57

   
**GM or Aggie:** He hadn't made met Ignatius yet either because he turned around right when you heard the argument.  
**John Hagey:** Oh yeah.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** You said this guy's boring and  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** He goes over to Ignatius Hands and he he's he wants to go down the line and talk and go to Aggie  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** left.  
**GM or Aggie:** and Brett and while he's excitedly do the Mazizi haven't  
**John Hagey:** Uh pleasure.  
**GM or Aggie:** had like a seed or anything. Do we a seed seat a seat?  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I don't think so.  
**GM or Aggie:** No,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Right.  
**GM or Aggie:** we haven't been integrated. Okay. So, it's just been like a semi-shortterm weapons trade and that's it. Yeah. Like Maybe so putting some of it together um there's I think what what Aggie would draw from this especially you know like I'm going to need to roll for it is like um looking back on on Harmony's actions up to this point so far it has been giving the clans everything they want to try to figure out why they want them so that they can do the exchange.  
   
 

### 01:35:02

   
**GM or Aggie:** because until until the the the energies of the lands harmonize there is no connection between them there. Now that said, they're they're obviously whether it's Harmony or for some other reason in the last two years aligning with right when harmony arrived. Now that you know the timeline of when the ash bloods were discovered and and shortly thereafter when um uh Sterling came through like that was about two years ago that was when the forest had a a market turn and it was not dying as much as it should have been. And so like you're definitely the leading consensus of the elders is that harmony has is is the reason the force is not dying, but they're also the only way to kill it. And so that's been like the trade so far. And looking back on it, you might you might be realizing that the the things Harmony have been trying to do is trying to figure out like why why is it not dying? We'll kill it in all these different ways so that we can understand it because that's what you want to do and like that's easy for dissection later.  
   
 

### 01:36:05

   
**GM or Aggie:** So, I guess a win-win. Um, but I think that's kind of maybe that's like the out of character thing. You can interpret how you would understand it. So, yeah. So, then Percy comes around, he comes back, he's like, "Hi, hello." Possible. Hi. Um, I have never seen a shirt like that. Is it What is it made of? mushroom. Your shirt? Yeah. Are is any of this something you put on every day? No. Me? Except for like the belt holding her pouch or something. Yeah. Um Yeah, that's kind of like Yeah, that's that's that's like a Oh gosh, I just met him. What's his name? Bramble. that's like rainbow style. And he points over at the basically tree, like the int person who's over there, like the the Groot looking guy. Um he's like, "Yeah, he doesn't he doesn't need clothes either. That's awesome." I think I would probably get in trouble if I tried that.  
   
 

### 01:37:19

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um I also What does it mean that you're mushroom? I'm a mushroom. Did you like did you did you plant yourself like No, you have you have like parents. Yeah. I mean I'm part of turtle. So you're Wow,  
**John Hagey:** Ignatius  
**GM or Aggie:** that's crazy. I I mean that's not that's I guess it's life, but like life finds a way, huh? Yeah. Cool. Cool. and and you're  
**John Hagey:** is understanding what he's trying to ask her is dying like laughing and trying to hide  
**GM or Aggie:** and  
**John Hagey:** it.  
**GM or Aggie:** uh okay and you're sorry are did are you easy well I I mean I guess both of you because I don't know this is my cousin Rick Hi Pible  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Hi, nice to meet you, Brit. This is This is Virgin on a microaggression.  
**GM or Aggie:** Oh.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Perival.  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh, well, it's just about knowledge, right? Like, you probably don't know what my toes look like.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I can see them.  
   
 

### 01:38:39

   
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I  
**GM or Aggie:** Do you want to see them?  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** do.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Take off his boot. So, I thought you said you'd get in trouble if you took your your stuff off. Oh, yeah. There's like That's kind of weird, right? There's a certain number of things I can take off and it's okay. But if I take off too many things, it's now not okay. Interesting. It's kind of annoying. But like if you're young enough, you don't have to wear anything. And then when you're old enough, you don't have to wear anything. But like the middle, that's so good. I got to spend a lot of money on this. Don't think it looks nice. I You look great. It as far as I understand, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have your flower crown on? Uh yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** Oh,  
**GM or Aggie:** So, is that is that Can you It's It's fine.  
   
 

### 01:39:28

   
**GM or Aggie:** Like, okay. Gosh, that would be crazy. Um, so yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** heat.  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh, do you know where the other clans are? This is my This is I gota I gotta know. I just know our forest. How big is your forest? Is it like It's like He like pulls out a map. He's like, "And you've But you've been Have you been other places?" No. Have you been other places? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've been all over. I've been I've been almost as many places as old Saraphina has been. But uh and then she's like she slaps him on the shoulders. Prisc stop, Sarah. And oh yeah, sorry, Sarah. Um, but I Yeah, I've been all over. I got I got I got Yeah. But now I'm here. That's where I want to be. That's cool. Are you from Septin, too? Uh, I've been to Septin. It's little.  
   
 

### 01:40:28

   
**GM or Aggie:** It's kind of It's foresty, but it's like more piny and y'all are like I don't really know.  
**Luke Foreman:** Oops.  
**GM or Aggie:** It's kind of like stone sometimes looking. They're also look like swamp, but they have seeds. I don't really know how to describe. It's different. Uh no, I'm from the desert. I'm I'm from I'm from uh like Shepa way over in the south. But yeah, I mean, so are you why do you want Why are you want to be an explorer? Well, we need to uh you know,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** find find the balance with life and death again.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** What do you do when things die around  
**GM or Aggie:** Well,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** you?  
**GM or Aggie:** we we I mean, guess it depends on who. If they're rich enough, they get a big parade and, you know, people have to go sit in church for a while and and then, you know, Yeah. Well, that's kind of a tricky subject. There's a lot of different pantheons.  
   
 

### 01:41:34

   
**GM or Aggie:** I personally, well, my family really just likes gold. That's kind of like our god. So, we just buy the richest place we can and put people in there and then it's like a thing. But it's usually pretty sad. So, there's that part. What do you mean you put like in the ground? Yeah, like eventually after, you know, we look at him for a while when they're dead. We put him in the ground. Oh, interesting. But what what do y'all do? Put them in the forest. Sounds kind of put them in the ground. Um they go back into to the cycle. Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean it's my grandma passed like two years ago. That that kind of stuff. Congratulations. What? Um uh thank  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Hi.  
**GM or Aggie:** you. Thank you. He turns to Sarah. Sarah Sarah and she's like um I think they really like death. It just part of life  
   
 

### 01:42:47

   
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Death is the way of  
**GM or Aggie:** from her from the grandparents death.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** things.  
**GM or Aggie:** New life comes. No, not really. She just is not here anymore. And she was here before. So like guess maggots lead her and that's that's gross. But she goes back into the cycle of life and death and life. Oh, so this is like a reincarnation thing.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** in a way.  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh maybe we won't solve this problem tonight. And uh I think you know as as the nights kind of worn on a lot of the the folks have started to like bleed away from the campfires and um really just kind of leaving leaving a few folks uh that are finishing off some of the engine grease which uh as Lomi's brought that back. Uh yeah. So, so as soon as you walk over the the blondhaired girl runs over to you, you lose like, "Oh, is this some stuff we can drink? Let's do it." And she like just takes one off and starts  
   
 

### 01:44:02

   
**GM or Aggie:** unccoring it. And she says, "Um, that smells like you try first." And she passes it to Lomi.  
**Luke Foreman:** Lomi takes a sip. Is it Is it more or less the  
**GM or Aggie:** This Yeah,  
**Luke Foreman:** same?  
**GM or Aggie:** I mean it's it's it's just some some good oldfashioned chime like had this this this take  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, I think he takes a sip and uh he he does like a  
**GM or Aggie:** before  
**Luke Foreman:** like a wineet tasting swirl in his mouth like ah. Yeah, they weren't kidding. That's that's some pretty good stuff right there. And then are they they're by the bonfire, right?  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** I think he he gets down on a knee,  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** takes a sip, and then keeps it in the back of his mouth, and then just goes over the fire and sees if it  
**GM or Aggie:** Nice. Heck yeah. It's definitely going to give a little and uh the girl  
**Luke Foreman:** catches  
**GM or Aggie:** is like, "Holy be that is sweet. I want to try." And she takes like a big bulb and immediately has a coughing choking fit  
   
 

### 01:45:20

   
**GM or Aggie:** and uh and then eventually like just spits a little bit and it makes like a little spark. It's like, "Oh man, I didn't I didn't do it very good.  
**Luke Foreman:** Hey, it takes it takes practice.  
**GM or Aggie:** Um,  
**Luke Foreman:** It takes practice.  
**GM or Aggie:** I'm I'm gonna go again. I'm gonna go again. I'm And she takes another swig and this time she she like you can see her bottling it up and she starts turning like purple. And you've you've seen some like magical displays here and there, some some cany level things with people showing off and um something like little fireballs in their hand or doing all sorts of stuff. But what you what you see happening with this girl is like her hair starts standing up and goes like you know full static electricity and she's just not swallow or she just like not swallowing it and yeah you I don't know just let me back up.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, he he sees what's coming.  
**GM or Aggie:** Uh she Yeah. So, two things happen at the same time which um would definitely catch the attention of Britt and Ignatius and and probably everyone else around the fire and many people nearby.  
   
 

### 01:46:40

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um, one she spits out h like a huge mouthful of the shine into the fire which causes a big and the second thing is that her hair collapses down straight flat up down and a huge purple lightning bolt crackles to the sky above her then slams back down and there's like this big boom and the fire does get bigger but all that display to the to her she didn't really even notice That's it. She was she and she immediately turns to me. She's like, "That one was pretty good."  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, that I mean that was something. I uh I don't think I'd seen anything like that  
**GM or Aggie:** But uh but it was just like what you did,  
**Luke Foreman:** before.  
**GM or Aggie:** but like I mean little little I'm a little taller, you know? So maybe it was the ankle.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, that and you did good. You did good, kid. That That was good. That was good stuff.  
**GM or Aggie:** the you hear this like clang as the literal jaw falls off of the uh the war forge next to you and the bramble the plank guy goes holy f\*\*\* girl and at at about the same time a few more things happen Britt and Aggie you recognize real who um was the exchange to the Mizi clan about a year ago.  
   
 

### 01:48:09

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um, she appears out of the crowd and grabs this girl by her shoulder and she's like, "We ah, there you are. We've been looking all over for you. Come on, we got to get back." And she starts tugging her away from the fire and you you the the blondhaired girl looks over like, "No, I don't I don't want to go. It's so boring. It was so many questions. This is so much more fun." And um I think at that point like Re's like, "No, but I I got us hot chocolate. I got hot chocolate. Just come come on back." And she's like, "Oh,  
**John Hagey:** Wait,  
**GM or Aggie:** I did like that." And this stuff doesn't taste very good. So, okay. Oh, good.  
**John Hagey:** wait.  
**GM or Aggie:** And as she's pulling her away,  
**John Hagey:** What's What's Lightning's Girl's name?  
**GM or Aggie:** you No one's asked it.  
**John Hagey:** Lightning Girl,  
**GM or Aggie:** Um,  
**John Hagey:** what's the name? What's your name?  
**GM or Aggie:** and so as you yell both her, well, actually she doesn't turn towards you, but real turns towards you and in her peripheral picks up Aggie and Brit and her eyes go like wide happy and she kind of waves.  
   
 

### 01:49:17

   
**GM or Aggie:** Agie Brit. Um, I need to take Zephyr, not Lightning Girl,  
**John Hagey:** Yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** you lava boy.  
**John Hagey:** that checks.  
**GM or Aggie:** And we got to go back to the building where uh um tomorrow after class, come find me tomorrow after class. I'm in this building over there. She points over towards the building that's like inset into the hill um which is grass covered one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um yeah, it's this one  
**John Hagey:** I'm gonna look at Lomi while you're explaining this and just look at him and go, "Did she just call me Lava  
**GM or Aggie:** right  
**John Hagey:** Boy?  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**Luke Foreman:** I mean, you did call her Lightning Girl, I think. Isn't that Isn't that what you said?  
**John Hagey:** I mean,  
**Luke Foreman:** Hey, I mean, maybe you already got nicknames for each other,  
**John Hagey:** yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** you know? That's That's cute. That's real cute.  
**John Hagey:** You like you have a point. But I at least took the I at least.  
   
 

### 01:50:23

   
**John Hagey:** All  
**Luke Foreman:** you you did ask her name,  
**John Hagey:** right.  
**Luke Foreman:** you know, that's that's that's fair play by you, but you  
**John Hagey:** I mean, I'm not I'm I'm not the only one here who's just astounded by the fact that we just watched someone get struck slashcaused lightning, right? Like that happened.  
**Luke Foreman:** I thought I thought it was the grease to be honest. So you saw that too?  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**John Hagey:** Look, man. I'm a dude that can make fire, so like I've gotten my fair share of like looks before, but I have never seen anyone struck struck cause lightning. I I don't know. That was that was  
**Luke Foreman:** She seemed fine. So I don't I don't  
**John Hagey:** wild.  
**GM or Aggie:** the war forge puts his jaw back on.  
**Luke Foreman:** know.  
**GM or Aggie:** He's like like, "No, she definitely caused that. That was that for her,  
**John Hagey:** Yeah. Like  
**GM or Aggie:** man. That that that was that was electrifying." Um, wow.  
**Luke Foreman:** Hey  
**John Hagey:** Hey,  
   
 

### 01:51:24

   
**GM or Aggie:** He's just like staring at  
**John Hagey:** we we we all appreciate a good  
**GM or Aggie:** her. Uh, Brit,  
**John Hagey:** pun.  
**GM or Aggie:** Aggie, what do y'all um what would be your reaction to seeing real? I think Aggie is happy to finally recognize Well, I know we saw her like earlier, but uh happy to recognize someone there.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yeah, I think I think the  
**GM or Aggie:** Would you Okay.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** same.  
**GM or Aggie:** Would you chase after her? Would you um be okay with seeing her after class tomorrow? I think she would be okay seeing her class, but also is kind of curious and like where do you think she's taking  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I guess back to the building we were in.  
**GM or Aggie:** her?  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I'm not sure, but there's a lot of buildings around us and I'm very interested to see what's happening in all of them. This is like a forest in itself.  
**GM or Aggie:** I think that phrasing gets Aggie convinced like, "Okay, I guess let's go see." Uh, as as Real's wandering away, I I think um you also hear or like Sarah comes over and she's like, "I'm sorry. Did you Did you know who that was?" Yeah,  
   
 

### 01:52:44

   
**GM or Aggie:** she she was in our village. She was about a year ago. Didn't she I mean, am I crazy or she the on the deans on stage? Yeah, that was her.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** Well,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Why do you know  
**GM or Aggie:** um there well I mean I don't I know of the dean by  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** her?  
**GM or Aggie:** reputation of course she's one of the the greatest inventors in our age and and a great explorer art in her age as well too but I did not I mean it makes sense that she now I I was very curious on who the lucky person was was going to be um like anywhere in her circle really but now that knowing that she's part of the clan makes a little bit more sense. the deans probably got a voracious interest in in the clan, especially if it can help her understand what's why them help us understand well um you all frankly a little bit better and and hopefully help each other more.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** help each other.  
   
 

### 01:53:44

   
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Interesting.  
**GM or Aggie:** I I mean that's the goal I think right? Is that why you're here?  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm. Exactly.  
**GM or Aggie:** Sarah's like kind of scared of Brett like um well he is to harmony I guess and she goes and and grabs the the other grease from Lomi and uh takes a swig and then passes it to probably an Aggie. Uh, she's definitely a little unsure about it. She like, and so she looks at Brit for like comfort. Like, should I take the tiniest little sub? Yeah. Uh, how would she react, do you think? I have no idea. Gonna roll for it to see how well she takes it. Um, same question for Britt. Is it once it comes around to her? Probably like seems like the front or finesse maybe. Yeah, I was I was actually just thinking strength. There's not really. Yeah, your vision's at 12\. Yeah, just do just do like straight. That's pretty good.  
   
 

### 01:55:32

   
**Luke Foreman:** Huge.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Oh, nice.  
**GM or Aggie:** Roll.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** A very good roll.  
**Luke Foreman:** Huge.  
**GM or Aggie:** Might uh take another slightly normalsized sip after the first baby one. Nice.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I think I think when you take this when you take the second uh the second sip, Brit points at the fire like I want you to spit it at the fire. See what happens.  
**GM or Aggie:** She's just gonna hand it to  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I think Brit knocks it back and says that's bad.  
**GM or Aggie:** Does she accidentally spit it into the fire?  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I think knocks it back first, says this is bad, takes a big second one, and then like like a dart at the fire.  
**GM or Aggie:** Nice. Nice. Yeah, it's just like a just like a fire  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** starter.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** H very interesting. Lots of new things we're seeing today, right, Aggie?  
**GM or Aggie:** Uhhuh. There there's so many new things.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I don't think we've met.  
**GM or Aggie:** So yeah,  
   
 

### 01:56:45

   
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Is Lomi over there yet? I don't think we've ever even met Lomi.  
**GM or Aggie:** let me let me come over with Sarah with the the  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Is this yours?  
**GM or Aggie:** booze.  
**Luke Foreman:** It's it's not mine,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** What is this?  
**Luke Foreman:** but it's it's something that we are very familiar with down in the boiler room. Uh name's Lomi Lomi Sultano. Boiler room. True and true. part of the part of the guild, part of the part of the what's the word?  
**GM or Aggie:** Turns the  
**Luke Foreman:** I'm what's the word I'm thinking? Part of the diamond union down uh down below in the in the boiler room.  
**GM or Aggie:** screw.  
**Luke Foreman:** Uh and uh this is a a bit of a drink of choice uh down in the boiler room. But uh hey, I mean I'll just keep talking. So uh what's uh what are your names? And I can see uh you all are are Not from here, per se, but uh it it seems like that's pretty common around here.  
   
 

### 01:57:45

   
**Luke Foreman:** So, that's that's pretty cool.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I'm Britt and this is my cousin  
**Luke Foreman:** All right. Welcome. Welcome.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Aggie.  
**Luke Foreman:** I I heard you say this is pretty bad. Um I mean it I think it's an acquired taste. I would say I you know thing is their own maybe.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** It's bad.  
**Luke Foreman:** What what's uh what you know what what do you usually drink if if you're celebrating  
**GM or Aggie:** Thank you.  
**Luke Foreman:** something  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Oh, like a like a tea. A pine needle tea.  
**Luke Foreman:** um you know you were blatantly honest with with me and I so I'll be blatantly honest with you that sounds bad to me.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Well, don't knock until you try  
**Luke Foreman:** Hey, you know, I would say the same thing,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** it.  
**Luke Foreman:** but you did try it, so you know, props for that.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** You mentioned working in the boiler room. What does that mean?  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, they, you know, there's, you know, you got to get got to keep the lights on around here.  
   
 

### 01:58:52

   
**Luke Foreman:** This is clearly a big big production. This is really my my first time being uh in in these areas. Uh mostly when when harmony when the the university moves and starts setting up. I'm I'm that's that's go time for us down in the boiler room. Got to keep those keep those cranes moving. So uh we're down there filling filling up the boiler, keeping it going, keeping energy to to the the rest of the university. And um it gets pushed it gets pushed a good bit. Uh and and hopefully there there'll be a way that uh we can prevent it because it would be a bit of a catastrophe if if you know things happened and and it burned a little too hot. But uh yeah, it's it's a living.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** What? What do you mean by catastrophe? Like death?  
**Luke Foreman:** It could be there's projections either way of of you know explosions uh if it burns too hot or or even even if it's minor and it just goes down for a while that's that's all the power production down for the for the foreseeable future and you know that's that could be detrimental as well.  
   
 

### 02:00:11

   
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** What are you putting in the boiler?  
**GM or Aggie:** T.  
**Luke Foreman:** We're not not tea, not grease. Uh we're putting in some uh it's it's like more or less coal, right?  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. So, you you would be having two power sources.  
**Luke Foreman:** Is  
**GM or Aggie:** You would be using some from the ash blood isle if you just wanted raw steam.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** I was about to say  
**GM or Aggie:** Um,  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** which which is nice because it doesn't like need to burn. It just is hot. So,  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** it's mostly just about keeping it infused. And the other thing is um the like the crystal batteries of harmony are essentially like condensed energy that you would be converting into power for whatever is needed. So like it' be you know it's closer to working in um like a in some ways a more modern industrial room like your stuff is  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** more about managing pressure and valves than shoveling coal into fires because the power is not  
   
 

### 02:01:08

   
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** necessarily the problem. It's the management of the power and making sure things are still  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** working.  
**Luke Foreman:** Well, we we get the power from various sources,  
**John Hagey:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** you know. We do have the traditional sort of s  
**John Hagey:** I mean, Lomi, I would assume you, Lomi, I would assume you use the the leidian from from the ashwood, right? I mean, it if you're going to heat something up,  
**GM or Aggie:** Obsidian.  
**John Hagey:** that's that's my assumption.  
**Luke Foreman:** It is the best. It is the best.  
**John Hagey:** I have now named it Leidian.  
**Luke Foreman:** I like  
**John Hagey:** Leidian.  
**Luke Foreman:** it.  
**John Hagey:** Just take lava and obsidian and smash those two babies together.  
**GM or Aggie:** All right. Yeah, that's I dig  
**Luke Foreman:** That is It is the best truly.  
**GM or Aggie:** it.  
**Luke Foreman:** And I'm not just saying that because it's got its own heat. you don't have to deal with any sort of uh any sort of combustion or anything which is more old-fashioned I'll be fair but we still do have some uh coal boilers and whatnot but generally we have our our condensed batteries our condensed energy that that we utilize for the most part but but it has been a uh a revolution since the Lidian trade has has occurred and and it's uh it's it's been the best part of my job trying to trying to work work with that and figure out the balance and  
   
 

### 02:02:26

   
**Luke Foreman:** and keeping things running on time and minimal downtime. So, it's a mix of things.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** H. This leidian, is there an unlimited amount of it? What happens when you run out?  
**Luke Foreman:** I think Ignatius uh I mean he's he brought a piece with him,  
**John Hagey:** Well,  
**Luke Foreman:** a little piece of home. I saw him pull it out. So I let him know you you tell them.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Would you have heard that question,  
**Luke Foreman:** I I'm not sure.  
**John Hagey:** well, Well,  
**Luke Foreman:** I would have pulled him  
**John Hagey:** that's to be to to be fair,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Ignatius?  
**Luke Foreman:** over.  
**John Hagey:** that's one of the driving factors of this um relationship with Harmony is in and one of my one of my personal um motivations for joining because I I want to find a new a new source of Lidian. And we we have plenty and ever since Harmony, it's been burning hotter, but not nearly as hot as it used to burn. So, I want to find I want to find the the the heart of the volcano, if you will, the heart of the magma that I want to find the next Leidian deposit.  
   
 

### 02:03:31

   
**John Hagey:** I want to find the next thing that's going to I want to find the next thing that's going to reheat our volcano because it's been cooling. It's been going under this great cooling for a while now. And I I I I don't trust that Harmony is going to always be able to to reheat it. And we need we need to have the ash bloods. We need to have our own independent form of leidian and  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** H.  
**John Hagey:** heat.  
**GM or Aggie:** Do you think that do you think that well okay which is in character out of character? Uh now it's out of character. Do you think that Ignatius is more interested in understanding why the Lidian is getting hotter over the last two years or  
**John Hagey:** I think it's a I think it's a combination, right?  
**GM or Aggie:** why?  
**John Hagey:** Like the problem is the we were warned about the great cooling and we went through the great cooling. The Lidian is getting hotter which is good.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** So when he when Ignatius is looking for a source like he thinks that the adventuring is going to either literally produce a physical source or it can be a physical source of like more Lidian that's heated or it can literally be the source of why is it heating back up.  
   
 

### 02:04:56

   
**John Hagey:** Either way, it solves the problem of if I can find out why. If I find out why it's reheating, I can then, you know, potentially control that or it can be just finding more listening. Both solutions find the or both of them are solutions to the same problem. But being this is more or less an adventuring guild. Either way, he has to go adventuring, exploring to find it.  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay. Well, cool. Um, that's it's very noble. Uh, do you forgive me? I I've I've heard some contradictory things from other ash bloods. It seems like some some of um well, I met one named Emma just outside of the the intake exam and she was pretty I don't know how to explain it. like excited to not have to touch fire ever again. And and she I think she even said like tonight that we had talked about maybe going to the fire together and she didn't want to go because it was it was too like organic. She was so excited to just feel power not from fire.  
   
 

### 02:06:09

   
**GM or Aggie:** Feel heat not from fire. Is that normal? Is that different from what you feel?  
**John Hagey:** It is. Man, I'm trying to do this without being like out of character. I'm trying to do this without the maturity of an adult. Like, what would like a young 17, 18year-old like think about this? Hold on, let me get on like let me download Tik Tok real quick.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** It'll teach me. um you know to you know you know honestly to each their own whatever they want but to to disrespect your heritage like that and to disrespect all of our ancestors before us by turning to quite honestly a a less a a more inferior a less primal form of heat is just I I think it's disrespectful. Look the the Harmony's batteries are great for moving things. If things got to move they're they're great for that. But when it comes to producing heat, like you're not going to find anything better than this  
**Luke Foreman:** Hey, I I have no qualms with that.  
   
 

### 02:07:14

   
**Luke Foreman:** You're absolutely right. You know, it's not it's for us humans.  
**John Hagey:** it  
**Luke Foreman:** It's It's I guess we're all humans. What What am I What's harmonians?  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah,  
**Luke Foreman:** For for the for the harmonians,  
**GM or Aggie:** we can work on that.  
**Luke Foreman:** it's Yes.  
**John Hagey:** all us citizens of harmony.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah,  
**Luke Foreman:** For for all the workers in the boiler room,  
**GM or Aggie:** that's it.  
**Luke Foreman:** it's a little tough to manage because it is heated. So, it's, you know, a little bit more difficult for us to to move around and and manage. If they if they offer an internship, man, you would be the employee of the year going down there being able to move move all this stuff around without without the heavy gloves and all that that we have to wear. Oh, man. But like you said,  
**GM or Aggie:** And I'll also say Loi something else interesting that you've learned about Lilidian is a two years ago when the first small import came in like one or two you know it was measured it was given a thermal like number and Um, now the Lucidian is measuring like 80% more heat per gram than it was previously, which has actually meant that a lot of people have like overbought Lidian because they didn't need as much as they have  
   
 

### 02:08:33

   
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** now.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** And so storing it has actually become kind of like a a second trade. Um, so there's like a second market of people reselling their Lidian because they don't need it as much anymore. it keeps that's also become a problem because people's boilers are like exploding because it heats too hot. Um, and versus the harmony batteries which are if they're one thing it's stable. They never change.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** It's it's definitely not as as raw or pal or powerful. There are other sources in harmony that could be more singularly hot, but that like consistent burn of the the licidian is is is definitely novel. Um it does it does seem to um like it's there's some sort of halflife to it though. Even even the the the stone that you're carrying with you um Ignatius is it's no longer getting um you probably wouldn't notice in in the span of days, but it's a measure that like over a certain amount of time listening does started start to like taper and hold and then it'll just kind of go up again.  
   
 

### 02:09:40

   
**John Hagey:** Sure.  
**GM or Aggie:** But the further it gets from an ash blood isle there there seems to be a little bit of loss but not as much as you'd expect. from like the time it takes to get to wherever you have to get it  
**Luke Foreman:** Gotcha. And we really went off the off the rails there.  
**GM or Aggie:** to.  
**Luke Foreman:** What was the original question?  
**John Hagey:** Well, uh, she was just telling me about Ember, who came from my island, but, uh, she's just she's so enthralled with the new stuff and everything else. She's kind of just honestly, if you ask me, she's just kind of disrespectful to to the culture and the the history of our ash of the ashwood, our ash blood. And yeah, you know, they some people just they want the the newest things and they just they just sometimes don't really care about the culture and and what's always  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Um,  
**John Hagey:** worked.  
**GM or Aggie:** so that that Ignatius is kind of like the divide right now in the Ash culture. You know, you're on one side, that would be the those are like the two conflicting ideologies.  
   
 

### 02:10:53

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um, Amber actually, uh, you know, it was one of those that like you were childhood cousins but not actually have any family rel relatives. So you I think you actually knew Ember pretty well and we can go back to that in in a future time,  
**John Hagey:** Yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** but she's always been I know.  
**John Hagey:** I just dissed her. I'm not going to let her let them know how well I know her. If I run into If I run into her,  
**GM or Aggie:** I know. I know.  
**John Hagey:** it'll be pretty obvious.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** But  
**GM or Aggie:** But I I I think it's a kind of a cool like that's um we can we can play how that how y'all's relationship like grew over time, but that was always her thing. She just whatever whatever it was, she just was super into the shiny and new stuff and um but okay. Um, so that I think at this point like uh Sarah has has said has said good night and and so have the other folks there and it's really just I mean it's getting pretty late.  
   
 

### 02:11:46

   
**GM or Aggie:** You have classes in the morning. Would anyone try to do anything else before starting classes the next day?  
**John Hagey:** I I do have a question. And so when we did the test originally, I remember because I I remember reading through the uh the preview was uh do did they give us like cards or whatever that like say like what your rank is or  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah,  
**John Hagey:** whatever?  
**GM or Aggie:** you have your little receipt.  
**John Hagey:** Okay, so you have the receipt.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Yeah,  
**John Hagey:** Okay.  
**GM or Aggie:** that's like your um that's the only thing that shows any indication of rank. And it it has been some people are flexing them like IDs. Look look at look how cool I am. I'm stamped gold right now. Um and presumably that's even more impactful over in like the other side of town where the kind of bougie parties are being held. But uh it it didn't really seem to be a thing by the fires.  
**John Hagey:** Right. Hey, hey, Lomi, you want to Lomi?  
   
 

### 02:12:55

   
**John Hagey:** Uh Britt and uh Aggie, you guys want to you guys want to go check out the uh the bajgeois the the the fancy area? I saw there was a bunch of well-dressed folks headed on over  
**GM or Aggie:** It's pretty late.  
**John Hagey:** there.  
**GM or Aggie:** Like you you would be you wouldn't be getting there during prime time. I think like we're getting into, you know,  
**John Hagey:** We already had prime time here at the bonfire.  
**GM or Aggie:** the Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** It was more fun.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Just not to say you can't do that, but just know that like,  
**John Hagey:** It's more of a curiosity thing.  
**GM or Aggie:** you  
**John Hagey:** Like I'm not Ignatius has no desire to to like mingle amongst  
**GM or Aggie:** know,  
**John Hagey:** those people there. He's just kind of curious about like what's it like over  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah,  
**GM or Aggie:** cool.  
**Luke Foreman:** I heard some I heard when I was finding my way over here,  
**John Hagey:** there?  
**Luke Foreman:** I heard some people talking about the Celestial Lounge. I I'd be interested in checking it out, just seeing seeing where it's at and what it what the deal is.  
   
 

### 02:13:46

   
**John Hagey:** Sounds fancy. Aggie Brit Celestial Lounge.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Looks at watch. Just kidding. Doesn't have a watch from the forest.  
**John Hagey:** I bet they have really good  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Um,  
**Luke Foreman:** Looks at the  
**John Hagey:** tea.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah,  
**Luke Foreman:** moon.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Looks at the moon.  
**GM or Aggie:** it does the finger  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Says, "I think we got one more party in us.  
**GM or Aggie:** thing. Nice. Okay. Um, this will either be a quick I'll I'll monologue or we'll end it and then pick up at the next session depending on anything that hooks y'all as you walk your way across campus. Um,  
**John Hagey:** Give us an opening  
**GM or Aggie:** so yeah.  
**John Hagey:** scene.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. So you're you're establishing shot if you will. It's it's kind of it's a bit of a bit of a haul to get there. You can see there's there's two gates into um into campus. This is like your fence around the campus.  
   
 

### 02:14:41

   
**GM or Aggie:** Uh if you're if you're zoomed out enough to see the cursor. Yes, there's there's gate on the west side that basically follows the line of bridges straight out the  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**GM or Aggie:** west. There's gate on the south side by the hangers. That's where you came in originally that gave you that first view of Harmony or of sorry of the MUA. And then um uh so there's like some classrooms and some some like dormatory housing. This stuff seems to be a little bit more like um the pedestrian side of campus. This might be where like the some of the the teachers live in these buildings. Some of the workers live in these buildings whereas students are are typically more in the you know the spircape which is what they call this elaborate collaboration of things except for the the the core circle. These are all classrooms. So everything around the deep hole, the the the the airship itself, this is all core classroom stuff um in this main courtyard. Um and then once you get outside the fence, there is like three huge manners and a line of of really nice and ritzy shops on like the northwest side of mouse of that of the map.  
   
 

### 02:15:55

   
**GM or Aggie:** the um there are several clubs that are built into these uh shops that you walk to on your way to the the large manners. Um and as you get a little bit closer, you can see that um the first manor has a little sign out front that says um like uh the golden welcome. And it's mostly at this point, you know, like all of the the traffic is mostly coming out. There's actually not very much traffic at this point anyways, but there's still there still seems to be some lights on and some people inside. Um, and then there is uh a gate that's closed in front of the other two houses that don't seem to be hosting. Um and then the uh the last thing is on the top floor of the um the tallest building as you turn is a sign called the celestial lounge. So there is like clubs the celestial lounge more clubs and then a what seems to be like a fraternity house party essentially in an upscale manner that was happening earlier in the night. So that's that's kind of the scene.  
   
 

### 02:17:10

   
**GM or Aggie:** Most of which are are winding are winding down. Um but still still some folks coming out. You um yeah, I don't know that you would see anyone you recognize. Uh but you do see some folks dressed like what Perl was dressed like. Um, and and there does seem to be kind of the vibe of of bouncers at the doors and they're not checking IDs, but if people stop and show them something, then you can see they get flagged and given a little golden like pin to put on their collar and then they can go in. So, it's sort of like reveal. You get the vibe. to reveal if you want to to to claim your status, but it's not they're not asking anyone. And that's that's kind of the vibe of all three of these entrances.  
**John Hagey:** Shall we check out the celestial  
**Luke Foreman:** Let's do it.  
**John Hagey:** lounge?  
**Luke Foreman:** Let's just see see see what the deal  
**GM or Aggie:** Okay,  
**Luke Foreman:** is.  
**GM or Aggie:** let's let's call it there for tonight.  
   
 

### 02:18:14

   
**GM or Aggie:** Heading into the Celestial Lounge for for a  
**Luke Foreman:** Stay out late the night before classes.  
**GM or Aggie:** uh yeah,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I  
**GM or Aggie:** going out late for a a night cap at the Celestial Lounge before class.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** know.  
**GM or Aggie:** I like it. Um I don't  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Do we sleep?  
**GM or Aggie:** know.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I don't know either.  
**GM or Aggie:** Like a minimum we would have to do like the 4hour Elvin long rest trance thing.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** A 4hour shell time.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah. Yeah. Go in, you know, put up your new your new paintings from the day.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**GM or Aggie:** Cool. So, starting up next time, Celestial Lounge will also um we're basically going to montage the first week of classes. So I'll I'll probably give you a class list and then we'll just talk through like why would you pick those things, what was interesting and then um you will take your second exam in next session which will update your rankings to the the latest one like you'll get a new receipt or it'll extend your receipt depending on if you have lost it by then or not.  
   
 

### 02:19:28

   
**GM or Aggie:** Um, and that's all y'all know right now about how class is structured. But you know that like the next even just I think I think there's enough there was enough chatter on the bonfire that though I didn't say it specifically some some other things you would have heard are like typically academy structure is the first week it's classes you get your test and then the academy has this thing called the loom which is basically um fed information about all the candidates takes all of the exams psych profiles and it's it's building what it thinks are optimal adventure team themes for the academy. So, it's taking the remaining people and breaking them up into like the optimal spread of types of adventuring parties so that Bumboula can most likely have a successful like graduate explor. Um, and so you get you kind of get assigned your group and then that group uh is is make or break for the first year. instead of just being individuals passing the exams, that whole group has to pass and if any if it fails, everyone gets gets uh gets kicked out of school basically.  
   
 

### 02:20:38

   
**GM or Aggie:** So um and then the next so that's like jet ed classes a week of rest which is mostly just um interviewing captains and to get on your first uh venture journey which is a one month short excursion to um to get like your your trial at sea because the academy really prioritizes like education by doing versus education by classroom. So, but you have to get people to take you on and you'll you'll get that captain list after the first I would normally do some of that stuff in character,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Cool.  
**GM or Aggie:** but I feel like we have long enough gaps between things that maybe it's helpful to see the the  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** No,  
**GM or Aggie:** pacing.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** that was helpful.  
**GM or Aggie:** Yeah,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Cool. I'm  
**Luke Foreman:** Definitely.  
**GM or Aggie:** mostly I just want to meet characters and maybe learn a couple more things about Harmony tonight.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** excited.  
**GM or Aggie:** So, go beans.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Love it. When What's next time? When is next time?  
**GM or Aggie:** Let's look.
