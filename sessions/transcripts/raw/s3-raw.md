### Summary

Holly Strebel and Luke S discussed Holly Strebel's need for winter gear, including snow boots, for an upcoming trip to New York, where they plan to visit Central Park for sledding, explore Chinatown and the Chelsea Market, and support Maria's determination to meet Tom Felton, with John Hagey's approval. In the game session, the characters arrived at the Celestial Lounge, where Lomi, Brit, and Ignatius were drawn to the impressive view of Vimua, leading to Luke S implementing a "cartography" experience trait for Ignatius, after which they encountered Val and Ember and played "Crown and Ruin." The game session concluded with Brit being ambushed by Azer, Nickel, and Tus, resulting in Brit sustaining major damage, losing a test receipt, but recovering a family heirloom necklace before Lomi punched Azer, leading the group—Ignatius, Lomi, and Iggy (Holly Strebel)—to plan to find Lucky using Lomi's story and Brit's retrieved pocket watch as leverage. The participants finalized the next meeting date for the 9th, with Luke Foreman, Holly Strebel, and Luke S available, despite Sophie Foreman Noone and John Hagey having scheduling conflicts.

### Details

* **Discussion of Winter Gear and New York Trip Preparations**: Holly Strebel and Luke S discussed Holly Strebel's lack of winter gear for an upcoming trip to New York, despite living in Colorado. They confirmed Holly Strebel needs to acquire snow boots and other items, noting the weather forecast includes snow from Monday to Wednesday, but with relatively mild highs in the upper 30s and low 40s. They considered the possibility of rain being worse than snow, and acknowledged that while the melted snow makes walking fine, high snow barriers could necessitate walking further to cross certain sections.

* **Sledding in Central Park and Indoor Activities**: Holly Strebel expressed excitement about seeing Central Park with snow and the need to acquire a cheap sled or use an improvised item like a trash can lid for sledding. Holly Strebel mentioned looking for indoor activities to use as breaks from the cold. Luke S committed to trying not to work during the trip, although they acknowledged the temptation to catch up on hours when stuck inside.

* **Shopping Plans in New York**: Holly Strebel and Luke S discussed plans to visit Chinatown for knockoff purses and to check out the Chelsea Market. Luke S mentioned that two unrelated people strongly recommended the experience of following a person down alleys for bootlegged fake purses. They concluded that the sketchy purchase would likely require cash.

* **Maria’s First Trip to New York and Tom Felton**: Holly Strebel shared her excitement for Maria's first visit to New York. Luke S confirmed that Marie is determined to meet Tom Felton and that the group has a plan, including bringing copies of their wedding invite for Tom Felton. John Hagey approved of Tom Felton as a potential plus one.

* **Transition to Game Setting and Character Status**: Luke S started the game session by establishing the character locations, noting that most of the group had been by bonfires and were now making their way to the Celestial Lounge. The time was estimated to be between 1:00 AM and 2:00 AM. Luke S also mentioned that the characters might have heard Valyriius's radio broadcast earlier in the night.

* **Character Energy and Night Owl Status**: The characters' energy while walking to the Celestial Lounge was described as reflective but still relatively high, shifting to deeper conversations. Luke Foreman suggested Lomi is a night owl, while John Hagey stated Ignatius is curious and riding a high from the new experience. Sophie Foreman Noone noted that Brit is not a night owl and would typically be an early riser.

* **Anomalous Instinct Check and Brit’s Reluctance**: Luke S requested an instinct check to see if anyone noticed the presence of an object on the ground as they were leaving the campus, which resulted in Lomi getting a bad roll. Brit was described as "a little bit annoyed" but still with the group as they headed toward the fancier gate.

* **Arrival at Celestial Lounge**: The group arrived at the Celestial Lounge, encountering a man in a butler's outfit acting as a quasi-bouncer outside the door. Luke S noted that the area was quiet with minimal traffic, mostly students returning to Booma. The view from the top floor was described as impressive, overlooking the large city of Vimua, the Sky Spire balloon, and the steam stacks of Deepole.

* **Character Reactions to the View and Cartography**: Upon reaching the top floor, Lomi and Brit were immediately drawn to the window, feeling overwhelmed by the scale of civilization. Lomi commented on being able to see where the steam and plants were located, like viewing a map from the top. Ignatius was noted to be actively using a notebook to detail what Lomi pointed out, creating a map.

* **Implementation of Cartography Experience**: Luke S instructed Ignatius to add an experience trait called "cartography" to their character sheet with a value of two, which can be used for checks to navigate or gain insight into buildings within Vimua. This experience reflects the knowledge gained from this new, high-altitude perspective of the campus and city.

* **Encounter with an Acquaintance and Ember**: Ignatius encountered an acquaintance, later identified as Val, who immediately recognized Ignatius from the entry exam. Val was happy to see Ignatius and immediately noticed the grease on Ignatius's arm. They saw Val's cousin, Ember, sitting nearby behind a glass studio with recording equipment, taking notes.

* **Introduction to the Game "Crown and Ruin"**: Val immediately suggested playing a game, offering "Crown and Ruin" or "Truths and Treachery," and explained that Valarius, their cousin, had passed out playing. Ignatius, Lomi, and Brit agreed to play, with Brit only if it was fast. They learned that Val and Valarius are both called "Val".

* **Game Mechanics and Play Session**: The game "Crown and Ruin" was explained as a contest using two d12s (Hope and Fear dice) where players bank the difference if Hope is higher than Fear, aiming for a total of 10 points without going over. If Fear is greater than Hope, the player marks a stress point (takes a shot of grease). Lomi introduced a flask of sharper engine grease to make the shots more challenging. Ignatius won the first round by successfully stopping at nine points.

* **Controversy over the Exam and Lucky**: After the game, Lomi pressed Val about the exam scheduled for the first day of class, leading Val to admit that they wrote a hard test and sold it to Lucky as a "study guide". Val claimed they did not want to make money but wanted to ensure students who got the answers would have good fundamentals. Following this admission, Val passed out from the combination of drinking and lack of sleep.

* **Next Steps and Brit’s Departure**: With Val passed out and Ember having returned to taking notes after losing, Ignatius proposed that the group needed to find Lucky. The attendants began to clean up the abandoned floor, and Brit attempted to follow the other group that had just left.

* **Lounge Entry Requirements and Atmosphere**: The lounge was theoretically for gold-status individuals, though receipts were being checked inconsistently at the entrance when some people walked in. The atmosphere in the lounge was compared to a free trial of a nice club, with people sleeping on couches and dressed in various ways.

* **Following the Serious Group**: Sophie Foreman Noone, playing Brit, followed a group out of the lounge that had a noticeably different, more serious demeanor compared to the jovial, game-playing crowd. The group consisted of three men: two large, brawny individuals and a smaller, urbanly dressed man who appeared to be the leader. The group's overall energy was described as sad.

* **Departure and Observation of Communication**: Brit and Iggy, who were following, observed Brit's trailing group communicating through sign language rather than speaking, but it did not appear secretive or furtive. Brit, having eyes on them, attempted a Present roll and intuitively felt that the smallest man was in a leadership role, with the two larger men deferring to them.

* **Approaching the Group for Directions**: Brit approached the three men to ask for directions to block 99, saying they were a student. The smaller man, who was not a current student but had attempted the candidacy run before, offered to point them in the right direction and mentioned they knew the campus well.

* **Iggy's Trailing Route**: The group, including Brit and the three men, began moving in the correct direction for campus, though it was not the shortest route Iggy would have taken. Iggy was keeping a distance from Brit and the men, exhibiting over-socialization avoidance.

* **Initiating a Game of Evasion**: The smaller man, later introduced as Azer, began to turn down random side roads to see if Brit would follow, turning the navigation into a type of "lose the tail spy game". Iggy, despite wanting to go to bed, continued following them, but was falling further behind the more winding route they took.

* **Losing Direction and Ambush**: As they continued, Iggy noticed they were no longer heading toward campus, entering an unfamiliar part of the city. When Iggy attempted a shortcut to get ahead, they lost track of the group for a few minutes after rolling with Fear during a knowledge check. Brit and Azer ended up alone in an alleyway where Azer stopped and expressed belief that they had lost Iggy.

* **Attack on Brit and Damage Assessment**: Azer apologized to Brit, and Brit was then struck on the back of the head by the two large men, sustaining 19 points of damage from two successful attacks against their evasion score of 12\. Since 19 damage is above the severe threshold (15), Brit was facing severe damage, but chose to spend all four of their armor slots to reduce the damage to major. This reduction meant Brit took two points of damage, placing them at four out of six total health points, and leaving them with zero armor slots remaining.

* **Brit's Actions While Grappled**: After the blow, Brit was wrapped in a net and effectively grappled, and the assailants began searching their pockets. Brit used their phone network feature to send a message to Aggie containing rudimentary directions (left, right, left, right) and the instruction "find Iggy," requiring them to mark a Stress point for perfect recall of their location.

* **Breaking Free and Losing Possessions**: Brit successfully rolled against Strength to break free from the net, but this resulted in a Fear outcome for Luke S, allowing the antagonists to seize their test receipt from their pocket. Azer and the two large, silent assailants were attempting to ambush Brit, and Azer expressed disappointment that Brit had "nothing of value". Azer then attempted to snatch Brit's wooden family heirloom necklace and succeeded on a second attempt after the first missed.

* **Assailants Split Up and Brit's Pursuit**: The assailants split up after taking the possessions: the two large men left with the test receipt, and Azer ran away with the necklace. Brit chose to pursue the necklace, which was 100% their priority.

* **Iggy Intervenes and Brit Catches Azer**: Iggy, after successfully rolling for a shortcut, popped out onto the main thoroughfare, arriving later than expected but directly in front of the fleeing Azer. Brit, moving quickly despite the strange, slow appearance of their turtle-like movements, was visibly enraged and successfully used an Agility roll with Fear to tackle Azer and regain the necklace. This action caused Brit to take a Stress point, bringing them to six out of six stress, meaning any further stress would convert directly to damage.

* **The Group Confronts Azer**: Iggy initially chose to disengage from the confrontation, assuming Brit had the situation under control, while Brit held Azer at knifepoint. Aggie, Lomi, and Ignatius then arrived, having followed Brit's frantic message, and found Brit pinning Azer. Aggie was concerned for Brit and asked what was wrong, to which Brit explained that Azer took their significant family pendant, which was an acorn shell or petrified wood necklace. Azer then returned the necklace to Brit.

* **Interrogation and Retribution**: When asked if anything else was taken, Azer revealed that the two other men, whom they named as Nickel and Tus, took the test receipt, but claimed it was worthless as the loom knows who a person is regardless of the paper. Brit then ripped Azer's pocket watch from their pocket as a replacement for the theft of the necklace. Lomi, upon hearing Azer rationalize their actions and calling the group irresponsible, punched Azer in the gut, breaking a rib and rendering them helpless against the wall.

* **Plans for the Following Day**: After the confrontation, the group decided to focus on finding Lucky, who was rumored to have the study guide. Ignatius and Lomi decided to prepare a plan together, which would grant them two Hope each. The plan was to use Lomi's story of "heroically saving Brit" by breaking Azer's ribs, and Brit's retrieved pocket watch as a bargaining tool for the study guide. Iggy, whose maps could be used to mark search locations, would also be accompanying Lomi and Ignatius.

* **Campaign Duration and Long Rest Mechanics**: Luke S estimated the campaign could reasonably last eight or nine sessions, given the players' enjoyment and the remaining planned activities both inside and outside the school. To conclude the session, the group conducted a long rest, where they were reminded that each participant can choose two actions from four options: fully resetting hit points, clearing all stress, repairing all armor, or swapping out domain cards. Holly Strebel, playing Iggy, chose to clear their stress.

* **Discussion of Previous Session and Location Dynamics**: The participants discussed the geographic movements of Luke S, noting their experience moving between continents, specifically mentioning India and Norway during a previous session. Luke Foreman noted that the current location or task is easier for them to hold onto compared to others they have dealt with.

* **Initial Scheduling Constraints and Availability**: Luke S stated they could not meet any earlier than March 5th. The conversation turned to Luke S's birthday on the 14th, which they mentioned they would be spending in San Juan. Holly Strebel reported being completely free the week after next, spanning the 9th through the 13th.

* **Confirmation and Complication of Next Week's Scheduling**: Luke Foreman confirmed they were also completely free during the week of the 9th through the 13th. However, Sophie Foreman Noone intervened, stating they could not do that entire week because their in-laws would be in town. Sophie Foreman Noone suggested the others should feel free to meet without them, mentioning they could be recovering from injuries.

* **Finalizing a Specific Meeting Date**: The participants decided to schedule a meeting on the 9th, with a secondary option of the 10th. John Hagey confirmed that the timing related to the 10th was a consistent issue. Luke S agreed to send Sophie Foreman Noone some materials after the final meeting date was set.

### Suggested next steps

- [ ] Holly Strebel will go to the ATM to get cash for buying bootlegged fake purses.  
- [ ] Luke will find Lucky.  
- [ ] Ignatius will find Lucky.  
- [ ] Luke Foreman and John Hagey will develop a plan to ace the test at the end of the week, which will be kept within the group of five people.  
- [ ] Luke Foreman, John Hagey, and Holly Strebel will find Lucky tomorrow, barter for the study guide using the story of Lomi saving Brit and the pocket watch, and Iggy will use his maps to mark search locations.  
- [ ] Luke S will send some stuff to Sophie Foreman Noone.

Granola transcript:
Meeting Title: Session 3
Date: Feb 25

Transcript:
 
Me: It would all be sort of artificial at that time. So I think. No, genuinely not a night out. Okay, so Britt's only nine owl, but the rest of the crew is at least open to it, or somewhat of a night owl. I like that thought of the forest is pretty dark, although it's kind of dark all the times. I figured there's also just like night life. Sure. Like the animals and critters coming out at night. And I think that's why I say slightly it's different type of ecosystem during the day. Logic. That's a good point. Yeah, I think I'm early. With the sunrise. Or a lot of night owl. So do you think Britt is. Trailing the group or reluctant to keep going out, or is she still on it? A little bit annoyed. But okay. Cool. So she's kind of set us up for where we were, which is where we left off, which was you all coming up to the Celestial Lounge. So all five of you are there in the road, and in front of you there is. A man in, like, a little sort of butler's outfit who seems to be acting as a quasi bouncer outside of the door that says Celestial Lounge. As you've been walking, it's been pretty quiet. There hasn't been very much traffic. Most of the traffic you have seen have been students returning back to. You're one of the few leaving at this hour. And, yeah, you come up to the doors of the Celestial Lounge. Trying to give you all a role play hook. I check it for traffic. I was like, I don't know if you all wanted to talk before you went inside, if you all were going to have a strategy or if it's just like, no, we're just trudging, going straight in. Sounds like I try to walk in. Yeah. I appreciate. Yeah, they're definitely not going to stop you. Okay, so, yeah, you work your way up to the top floor of the Celestial Lounge. This is a little bit more of a moody and modern vibe than I was going for. But I'll show it to you. Just because everyone likes to look at stuff. Yeah, it's pretty dark. And it's not that red either. In my mental image of the Mila, it's a little bit more. Like Oxford Steam. Not really steampunky either, but just more gaslit with vanilla crystals all around. You would see the balloon of the skyspire, which is wider than this one. This one's a little bit too Treasure Planety. And then you would see the steam stacks of Deep Hole, which is the huge cruise ship, which are like the two big buildings that make up the Bimbua Academy mobile campus. That are anchored in the center of the campus as we speak, built all around it. And the view is pretty cool, though. It's probably one of the higher points in the town of Bamila and one of the few places that you can see over the rooftops of the places around. And it is a pretty big city. There's probably half a million people that live here now, so the campus itself is obviously significant. At one point was 20% of the population, but it's going down. The population of the city continues to grow. And you come up to the top floor and there is some soft music that's fading or that's playing in the background. There's some empty glasses on tables. But over in the corner, you can hear some voices from someone who seems to be having a little bit of energy. And then a bunch of people are asleep on chases and couches scattered throughout the top level. And then towards the other way is just tables and lounges that don't have anyone in them. So there's sort of like a quiet corner, people sleeping in random places, and then a little bit of life over to the far side of the room. I guess we walk over to the far side of the Just Ignatius walking around commentating. So tired. I guess I'll just walk over there now. About halfway as you. Ignatius would be the only person to recognize. There is a guy who you have seen before. I don't know how good is Ignatius that named? How good is John? And names. Does John remember the name of the guy who tapped his shoulder on the first day after Ignatius took his entry exam? Hold on. Let me check my. If someone roll me an insight check, maybe. Because what I feel like is happening is that someone's probably good enough at reading people that they realize Ignatius knows this person is panicking. He's not personal. That is a person, though. But that's not the person. I guess he stopped. What did the rest of y'all doing? They just continued to follow him. I think Lomi is drawn immediately to the closest window. Maybe. As I. As lonely as ever. Been a book figure out? Yeah, sure. He's probably never had a chance to ride the like to get in the skyspire on one of the little sojourns that it does. So I would believe that it's probably one of the highest times. Is it changing his. His world being up here? Does he feel like one of the ribs? There's also a bougie club, too. Himself like. That's where all the steam goes, I guess. I can see where the plant is. I can see it from here. I think Britt joins Lomi by the window because. I think similarly, this is maybe the most. Civilization that she's seen in one area. So I think in a similar way, just kind of, like, drawn by the view. Yeah. Do you think that either Brader Aggie would have been like tree climbers to try to get a similar type perspective in the forest or. I think not, Brit. I think if there was like, the really stocky, easy to climb trees, he would do that. But she's not, like, super agile, zipping up difficult trees. It just like she can get a branch or two. Of not. Yeah, not up to the top. So Aggie and Britt standing by the window for the first time, seeing more than probably 50 people, 100 people. Let's say. Let's say that you might have been able to fit your clan into clearing a few times. That's a couple thousand people or so. Seeing, like, more orders of magnitude more than that. What do you all say to each other Because. Or is it just a silence? Shared, millie. I think ag is just like, whoa. Like, not really saying anything, just reacting, I think. Yeah. Just overwhelm. Silence. Below. He's like, that's where the steam goes. I think you kind of like a little kid. That. Days where we were taking our test, and then we came in and there's the boats. And, like, just admiring the map from the top, like, oh, yeah, I love that. Exactly. What about av? I was going to say. Pointing. Out things. He has, like. Pulled out his notebook. Again. And. He's, like, detailing. Everything, louie. Is pointing out. On the map. That he's drawn. That he's been trying to put. Together. Too. Surveying. And trying. To. Write down. As much. Nice. Yeah. This is a good, like, alternate perspective of the crane that he climbed earlier. So what I want you to do in your character sheet, add an experience. Called what you call, like, cartography. And anytime you need to make it, check to figure out where to go. Within or what buildings are around. I think Icke's got a good enough map that he'll be able to have a little extra insight to do that. I can do it for you too, if you want. There should be like a wrench by the word effects underneath the knowledge. And then you'll. You'll click that and then it'll give you a new details experience and a new experience. And then you'll just give it a value of two. And then make sure you give it a value of two, and then it'll show up in the bottom left of your character sheet. Cool. Yeah. So don't forget you have skills and stuff. Also, spin those hopes. Spend those stresses. You got them. Use them. So, Ignatius, no one really notices that you got. Did you freeze or would you have just sent it and got out to him and done a classic like PayPal? I. Think an age is going to go up. And be like, He gets his old. Hey, we've met each other. Daddy is? I don't know. I've met a lot of people. Ignatius. Ignatius, right. It was Ignatius, wasn't it? He puts his arm over your shoulder and then immediately has regret. And then he looks scared at his shoulder. And are you still. You haven't changed or anything since the test, right? Well, you did sleep one. No, you haven't slept yet. Yeah. So he's like, oh, I did not think. This jacket is just. It's not coming back from this. Is it? It's okay. It's the price of a bond. Okay, this is. These are. This is. And he starts gesticulating around to, like, a bunch of people who are asleep on chassis. He's like. That's. Well. Oh, wait, actually, do you know. And you look across the room and you see Ember, your cousin, the other Ash blood, who had, like, the little contrary opinion to you. She is sitting on the far side of the room behind this. This table. And behind the table is like a temporary glass studio with recording equipment inside of it. You see, like, a steel microphone and a bunch of wiring. And she's fastidiously taking notes on the table next by, and she's reaching in, investing with dials on the microphone box, and behind her on a couch is a man who is also asleep. And I was like, you're still awake. I told you I could find one person that would play game with me. No, I can't, ig. No, I'll just stick with Ignatius. You know what? Ignatius. Wait. Hold on. I'll get it. Iggy and ignatius. Great, great, great, great lads to have you here. You up for a game? Oh, God. We still hear. There we go. Sorry. I timed out of my session on my other profile, like, hijacked my screen. Imagine. I told you. Hiking. Someone to play? It's not that late. English. You play games, right? I played some games before. In my life. What game is this got? I got tons of options. We could play Crown and Ruin. We could play Truths and Treachery. Probably one of those two would be best. If you haven't played any of them before. Valerius, my cousin over there. He passed out playing crowns and crowned. And ruin. He got a little bit of ruin, but you'll be fine. Did you come in with a crew? Iggy, do you want to play too? Okay, again. Do you want to play a game? You know what a game is? A contest. Clash against wills for friendly competition. Friendly. Competitive. Yes. You don't like to compete, to challenge wit. Well, it's just for fun. Why don't you just. Well, you clearly aren't playing with the right people. Then you need to play with Val here, your pal. I don't. Think we'll be, pal? S after compet. Ition. You just have to give it a try. What do you say? You. What about these others? These are back. Oh, great view out there, you guys. Any interest in playing Crowded Ruin? Only if it's fast. Oh, I can. I can't. I can't guarantee it. Outside game. He just said play with your. But he just described his cousin as Valerius. Are they all, val? So far, two for two. Just like a eunuchous. A bit confusing at all. I mean, it'll feel fast because time flies when you're having fun with pal Val. Here I am, ready to go. I think I'm gonna. I got time. Let's play a game. What do we play? I was gonna open up. Brittany, I think I should probably go to bed, right? Kings and ruin. Cr. Own crown. It's all the same. Yeah, I think. I think it's possible that we would have played this before. I feel like he's kind of a gamer, basically. Well, once. Once he. I'll describe once we figure out if Aggie and Brad are going to go to bed or if they're gonna play. I mean. I think we play. We're here. Yeah. Ignatius brought you Bright yourself. You all here, so you might as well play. Exactly. And he pulls you. He grabs Ignatius and parks him at a poker table, basically. And then he starts shepherding. Everybody's like, nibber, stop working. The show is done. Valerius is asleep. He's not gonna see you anymore. Come over here and get up the table. And Ember, I think, looks at Ignatius and says, he's playing. I'll play and puts down her headset and comes over to sit next to. Rivalry between. Did they play too many games as children today? Yeah. I have this vision in my mind. I don't know that they. It feels to me like they were maybe close as kids, and then they just don't really get along much anymore. They're like Patrick and Holly for a while, and then they're coming back, coming back around that they're friendly. Well, you maybe haven't gotten to that arc yet. We'll see what the future holds for Ember and for Ignatius. But she definitely wants to beat you. Okay? So you're gonna need to use Foundry for this. You can either roll a skill check of your choice, basically, or just. Actually, I'm gonna test this real quick. I need two different colored dice. R dope. Yeah, there's dice are cool. I don't know. How do I roll duality dice for free, though? That's a question. So I'll just use. Yeah. You'll be rolling two D12s. And how this game works is you're gonna hope dice and your fear dice. And you're going to try to roll hope higher than fear. And it's the first person to 20 points traditionally wins. Okay, here we go. So you take two dice. I got a gold one and a purple one. Take a nice. Take it. Stick it. Passed out. All right, so now, everyone, go ahead and roll your guns. This is just practice. Just practice. And so you're rolled. Yeah, Just doing these skill check. We're gonna pretty much ignore the modifier. Just click, like any of your skill checks. Just one. Yeah. Look at all these dice stacking up, stacking up. So what's going to happen is if your hope is bigger than your fear, you bank the difference. So if you roll the ten hope and the two fear, you get eight points. So far, so good. If fear is greater than hope, then you're gonna mark a stress which in reality. Now, if purple dice less than your gold dice, then you're gonna take a little bit of grease. And he pours a shot glass in front of everyone with some grease in it. And if you roll doubles, that's a crowd in ruin. And you choose. Double your bank points or you might lose them all. That's up to you. Your risk. But point is, it's the whoever can get the closest 20 with their dice in this round wins. First to three wins. So you might roll two times, you might roll four times, you might never get there. And the furthest away. It's like 21, basically. Without going over. Yeah. It's like 31. It's the exact same mechanic, just with dice. If you've ever played 31. Right now, for example, Val, he's rolled a 12, that's purple dice. And a seven with this purple, his gold dice. So he takes a shot. No points for me there. And then he rolls again. And so we're gonna keep track. Everyone wrote like, is that making sense? How to do the math? Yeah. So. You're rolling. Two dice. Though, to get. Clicking formula in the chat, Holly. Then you'll see. For Iggy, you rolled an 11 and a 7. So it is that Iggy's at 4. You're only getting points of fear is if you didn't know, you just give a shot. Which is marking a stress on your character. Sheet. And once you mark. Stress is in the character sheet. There's hit points and stress, and you should be like 2 out of 6 stress, I think. So if you roll fear, then you're gonna take a shot. And at some point when you get to 6 out of 6 stress, you'll start losing health points directly for every stress point added. So I'm just. Adding. This. Again. Yeah. Nice. Thanks, luke. How come I wasn't added to the. Because I swear to you. Do you want us to roll out, Will, or do you want to go in order? We're all going to roll together because that's how you keep the shots at the same rate. You said the first one was practice. Yeah, Fair show was practiced. Val just took the shot. Of. Your hope or your stress. Right. Hitting. Which one? Was. Higher or lower. If you rolled like a ten with your hope and a two with your fear, then you got eight points. So you got four points right there from your 11. You should be changing on your last one. You have an 11 and 7, right? So it's just 11 minus 7. So you have 4 points. Right, and then you're trying to add that up. Which we might just play the 10 now that I'm thinking about the math. Adding and. Taking away my. Open. Oh, I see. So you're only adding stress if your fear is bigger than your hope and you don't get to add any points. And you add one stress every time. Every time. You'd have to. That happens. I only. Do that first job. Correct. It's just an aggressive drinking game. You're all high, and then you don't want to bust over 10 points because then you lose. So if you rolled. Your. Computer approximately three feet away. That's awful. I can roll for you if you. Want. Okay? It's there. It's just they're both plugged in. Different places. Soon after this practice round. This is a pretty chaotic game, right? Yeah. Wait a second. I didn't get it. I didn't get a gold dice. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Roll me like. I think Val's pretty. He's pretty good at the games, and I'm pretty sure he's wary about giving double gold dice. So. Yeah, give me. A presence, jack. Yeah. Do you think we're in, like? A kind of dark corner of the bar. Yeah, it's all pretty dark. I would say that there's a little. I don't know, probably not enough. Tell me, Worth. Tell me more. Like a low. Light or a heavier shadow area. Yeah, we'll allow it. We'll allow it. We'll allow it. All right. Is that a presence? Yeah. That'll be deceive. Nice little advantage in there. Yeah, it's pretty good. He's like. Where did that dice go? And he starts checking around. He's like, you know, they have a fear. Yeah. And he flicks you another one out of the bag of gold dice. Okay? So everyone ready? Make it the rules make sense. Roger. Two dice. A different take. Shot at the purple one's lower. Here we go. And Ember rolls a dice. Rolls a dice. Ember. Yeah. I think it's kind of tricky, though, because you got to figure out when to swap it. On. The first one. You don't have anything. To be if you have zero to bat. I've never seen a crit on the first. It will give you. Look at you. You choose how much you want to take, it's got to be less than eight. That'll be less than. Eight. Rolled 2 5, so I guess. I'll take the five. Five it is. Now we wait. Is anyone call it? So you want to type it out? And holding. You got to roll the other one higher. And really, both of them higher would be good too. Excuse me. It's not my fault you really roll. Okay, so Ember and Val both take a shot and the dice flying. In. Val. Val's getting damaged crit. Says I'm taking the eight. And she's going to sit at 8. So. If you're. Hoping to your. Tie. That's a crit. Yeah. So, Iggy, you just critted? So you choose what you want. Eight or less. You rolled twice. Yeah. You got four from your first roll. Which is still pretty good. So you'd be sitting at nine. Yeah. Double 12. Yeah, double 12. That is tremendous. Tremendous. See, that's how you do it, Iggy. Yes. Drinking round too. Luma is going to take a shot. Take the shot. And say, Oh, you guys up here. You drinking juice up here? Let's make this a little interesting. Pulls out like a little glass. And anyone who took a shot that round is going to fill it with the grease that we were drinking down by the bottom, okay? From around the corner. Yeah, so maybe the same abv, but it's sharper. It's got that pain when you drink it. Okay? Ember sees you roll your four, Ignatius, and she says, I'll take five. I'll stay at five. She switches from her egg. She doesn't want to lose to you at a nine. So ember is at 5. Ls taking two shots. You're going to roll again. We're in 10. We're going to 10. Yeah. We're trying not to bust. Try not to. Bus 10 or lower can't bust. What's the penalty? If you are the closest after everyone is done rolling, then you win. They didn't put any bet on it. You might imagine, like, money would be on the rounds, things like that. So it's just pride right now. And drinking. What is Iggy at after that? Crate. What did you choose? Eight or lower. Wait. What you choose. Anything eight or lower. I. Chose to stay, okay? What we're at. Ember's at 5. She switched it because she doesn't want to lose detonations. She thinks she got better odds. When you were younger. I have the right to choose when I have the data. It's not until the next rounds are old. Ignatius. Learn the game. She goes and grabs her dice and looks around expectantly at everyone. Are we ready? You're adding. It up. Oh, you already had four, so you're at eight, so it just doubled your previous points. You can only choose if you're on zero. Okay? I'm just going to let you count. Sorry. I thought you took a shot the first time. Because the practice one was the one you got points on. I thought. A point. On the previous. Yeah. Okay, perfect. Thanks, luke. I'm on. It. And val's at zero. Going on outside of the. Game. Is there anything going on? Elsewhere. In the bar. That I feel like. Britt is like, I. Said. Fun, but. Also kind of. Like, what are we doing? We're not specific. There's stuff happening tomorrow and what are we doing here? Yeah. Is there anything else she was noticed going on? Yeah, I think it would be hard for her to notice. About leaving the table. There's enough noise at the table. She does see that there is a group of two really big guys and one shorter guy who are like the only other people awake on the floor. And they're leaned over a table having a discussion. And it's probably hard for Britt to make out the body language and stuff, but that's the only other thing that's going on. But they're not playing a game. Different energy over there. Okay? And then you got, like, the radio stuff, people in Valeria sleeping behind you. Okay. All right. Let's roll one more. Close to. Her. If you. Find an exit. Tell me. Together. I love how you said that as you're inching off the screen. Val leans over to embraces. Tough luck. Last sixer. That's a bust. And he gives her, like, a red X token and he slaps it in front of her. And Amber does not. She will not need your eyes, Ignatius. And Val takes another shot. Right now. Struggle. Rough luck. That greases. Amber's like, this game's stupid. I hate this game. She just kind of gets up and goes back to the table behind and puts her headphones back on and start taking. Don't mind her. She gets a little. What's the word? Yeah. I want to say a little heated. I felt like that could be charged. He rolled twice. But her first promoter to ten. Ooh, a perfecto. Didn't want to roll on that one. Did she have to do anything or just. No. She was at 7. Okay, fair enough. Okay, so, Iggy, Iggy, what a comeback. You win. Congratulations. It can be or it could just be gone it could have just begun. I do have exams tomorrow. I bought that test just to see if it was any good. It was okay, actually. A decent study guide. I did write it. But I don't know. We could keep going. What do you want to do? You bought a test? Well, yeah. I wanted to make sure he wasn't changing it after I sold it to him. Why? What? So here's the beard. Cow. Val. Yeah, right. The test that we're all taking tomorrow. Oh, no, it'll be at the end of the week. At the end of the week, you, birthday class. Today, I guess. Yeah, five hours from now. So you wrote the study guide for it. What's up with that? Well, I didn't really write the study. Guide. I just Lucky wanted to make a deal, and I thought, well, I'll just write a really hard test so that if people are scared about it, they'll buy this test I sent. Lucky can't charge gold, though. He has to charge something funny or a story has to be basically free, because I don't want to make money off it. I got enough money, but I wanted to make it so that people, if they could get the answers on my test, that they would have really good fundamentals, because I have a really good advantage. My dad, he found him as easy, and he's really cool, but I want to be like that. I'm drunk. Anyways, I also wanted to build a test that. Yeah, if you got it, you could figure out the right answer and you would be pretty good. Set up for it tomorrow. Maybe. I don't know. I haven't actually seen the real test. I just have seen a bunch of these tests. Is he a student? Yeah. So you made a test and gave it to Lucky? Yeah. I love that guy. Are you lucky? I'm lucky. When. It was a real. Test. No. Lucky knew what it was. I told him. He couldn't tell it was officially a test. It was just probably very close to what the test might be like if I was to write the test. I hear. You. I appreciate a man. I work really hard and no one races faster than me. I hustle a lot. You sure do, pal. My and pours out of his. A couple more shots. Hands one to him. And picks one up and goes cheer night and cheers in general. And then does a classic just throw. Waits for him to kind of momentum. Behind his shoulder and. Pats him on the back. Val. He's been going pretty hard for a while. And that last round of quad shot, he literally did not roll one time. Higher number. His playing taken his toll on him. Suddenly that the table. Val still sort of chattering away, but you can see he's working his way towards the lounge where his cousin is, and he's just, like, going to pitch into the corner. It's good to hang out with you all. Wow, that really hit me fast. Well, it was in that. Sort of endearing. I also hate it. He just spammed it. Directly. And. We got to find. Lucky. Yeah. We got to find that damn academy. Okay, so after that, the table is just y'all. Britt, the group across is not there anymore. They got up a battle that last roll, and you saw them head downstairs. And yeah, it's just kind of an abandoned upstairs. You see that there is some attendance that are now coming out, starting to clear glasses and every now and then, They turn one of the chases into a futon for someone to sleep on and throw, like, a little blanket over them. And the music turns down a little bit. What do you all do? Can I have? Followed. The group. That left. And I just have kind of tailed them out. Yeah, you'd have to do it pretty quick. In the chaos of, like, he wins and then Mommy's pulling out the drinks and whatever. I just kind of turn and follow. Okay? Because the people who came into this lounge in the first place were supposed to be, like, gold status folks, right? Yes, kind of. What you had learned when you were walking in last time was that there was people checking receipts at the doors to see if you had a gold status on it. There's nothing that you had to do to get in. Sorry. They didn't check anything. You could just give them. You just saw people giving them the. Receipts, but they weren't asking for it. None of y'all tried that when you walked in. So you wouldn't know what I'm actually having if they had learned your actual rank. But that said, this was supposed to be. They were like recruiting gold ranked candidates to come here. But people sleeping on the couches are dressed in all sorts of different things. It's definitely a free trial to a nice club kind of vibe is what you're getting. I guess I just kind of follow the group out. And to see because you said their vibe was much different. Not like playing a game where jovial. Whatever. Can I catch up? Do I hear the threads at the end of their conversation? Or pick up on what they were talking about at all. Yeah. Interesting. Why were they there so late if they weren't? Sort of. Passing out or they seem serious. Yeah. I'll just ask any of the group if you would have saw Britt leave, because I think the rest of you decided to stay through the hand, but you might have had a chance to chase after her. But anyone who stayed and listened to Val talk about tests would have not gone with Brit because it had been that fast. Nacia stayed. What about Eggy and Aggie? I think Aggie was about to follow her. And then he mentioned that his dad found them as easy. And she's like, wait, what? So she kind of lingered back. But saw her leave with the intention of like, okay, let's see. Done. Then she's going to follow. Okay? I think iggy. Might have gone. He was looking. For? Get the heck out. Of there. I. Don't think I also don't. Read the window. What any. Thing that he was. Bragging about this. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. So Britt trailed somewhat quickly, but not rapidly, by Iggy. Something interesting you notice, Brad, is that they are not talking, but they are making a lot of gestures at one another. And. You don't hear anything. And Britt wouldn't know what any of these gestures meant, but they're using sign language. And I think you should intuit that that's how they're communicating. And it's not furtive or secretive. It's very obvious sign language. But yeah. I think. Go ahead and give me a presence, troll. You can if you want to, Iggy, but I was thinking more Bray, because she's had eyes on. Yeah, I agree. Okay. A tan. You've kind of feel like one of them is sort of in, like, a leadership, like the smallest one. It's three human men. Two of them are really big, brawny guys, and they have dreadlocks and piercings. And then the third one is just like, a classic urban. League dressed individuals. They're not dressed the same, in any case. You can see that the two big guys seem to be deferring to him a little bit, like they let him go first throughout the door. Not in a I work for you type of way, but just naturally happen to be kind of following him. The other thing. That you will notice. Is. Yeah, they just kind of seem their energy is not happy. Like all of them in general. They seem kind of sad. And enke too, I guess. I approach them and say, hi, I'm looking for block. Wherever I'm supposed to be sleeping. 99, I think. I don't remember where you were either. I'm looking for not fort. Yeah, Black four. Any idea where that is? The two big guys just tilt their head at you and they look at the smaller guy and signal a few things and. I think. Yeah, I know you're a student. I'm a student. Are you students as well? No. We didn't quite make the cut, unfortunately, so not for us this year. But I do know the campus a little bit. I can at least point you in the right direction. That would be great. Any tips or anything you have to share about. Welcome. Welcome. I live here. This is my city. I actually tried the candidacy right. A while ago. Didn't make it, let alone this big rush, but yeah. I know the city well, and he just kind of like, gestures you to follow him down the stairs out the front lobby. Iggy, would you have caught up at that point, do you think, and followed it outside? I think he knows. Where he's going. Are they going in the right direction? Given what? The map you drew earlier. They are going in the right direction, but it is not the route Iggy would have taken. Iggy would have just gotten point A to point B, and they seem to be going down. Like a smaller road into that will loop around slower back to campus. It's in the right direction, though. Just what you've drawn. I literally think he's probably only been to three places. If. It's one. More new. Kind of area. But I think he's keeping. He's pretty. Far. Keeping. His distance. Okay, so you wouldn't be right by the time. I think Britt is like, by the way, I'm Britt and. This is, and then he's just, like, way behind. I think if she finds to point him out, He? Ducks in high. Yeah. Are we being followed there by your small friend? No. That's kind of feels a little weird being stalked like that. But I guess now I'm kind of curious. Will he follow me if I just start turning random directions? I think it depends on where you go. If I'm honest, I don't really know. I'm going this way. Let's take a little detour. Let's see what he does. And he turns right down like a side road. Diggy. Same thing. Like, are you going to pop around the corner? Okay? So Iggy keeps following. He just kind of like playing it, almost like lose the tail spy game at this point. Let's get to the next chord, see if we can See if we can get there before he follows us. And then the little shadow. I'm, like, picturing it like the hatchling error in spongebob, which is. The guy, the spatula. Little short thing walking around. He runs around. Does he follow us? And then he would come around the corner. Damn, he's quick. But he wasn't actually trying to lose him necessarily. But you are getting further away from Iggy. The straights, he's kind of running down. So Iggy, you'd have to kind of jog. To keep up. Yes. He's. Like group two point. Zero. And I feel like. He can. Roll. But this guy. Is definitely trying. To. Make a game of his for sure. Yeah. There's a couple of times that. Okay, let's maybe roll, like. Him. Do, like, three. Turn. And then I would. Really love for him. To be ahead of him. At some. Point, okay? I love this. I love this. As Iggy is making that thought. One thing that you notice, Iggy, is that you're no longer going towards campus anymore. And whether that's because they're trying to lose you and they kind of actually accidentally got lost or for whatever reason, it's getting a little bit harder to know where you are. Because you just haven't drawn this side of the city. It kind of sounds to me like a little bit of a gamble from Iggy to try to get ahead and not lose them. To, like, cut a corner. So do, like, a knowledge check, which is your plus two. So, yeah, I'll take that fear. So with that fear, Iggy, you actually lose. I'm gonna spin that fear, and you're going to lose track of them for. A few minutes and you're just wandering down different roads, popping up using all the tricks of your trade, like listen for footsteps or whatever. And so flipping back to Brit, at some point is introduced himself Azer, by the way. I think y'all are now, like, in sort of an alleyway between two buildings. He's peeking out. He's like, I think we lost him. And he comes to you. He's like, I am sorry about this. And he's going behind you. You hear? You feel big thud in the back of your head. So I'm gonna roll two attack rolls against you. So the way combat works. In in this game is I'm gonna roll against your evasion score. Your evasion is a 12. So I actually just rolled a 12 with the first one in a 17 with the second one. Which then means they are going to roll. This is the total damage. So that's 19 damage. And you can see you have three different minor, major and severe. You see those? Like so. You got minor 8, major 15 and severe. So what happens is with 19 damage, that's above a 15, which means you're about to take severe damage. And you can. Yeah, it would go like initiative normally, so you'd get to your turn next and things. So what you can do is spend all four of your armor slots to reduce that damage from severe to major. But if you take severe damage, then you're going to take, I think it's three hit points of damage. And then it's two for major and one for minor. So that's how Dagger Heart keeps your health points really low, but lets big numbers of dice rolls happen. So that each injury is kind of scary. And then when you get to a long rest, you only have the options to reset armor slots for stress or change your domain cards. So it gives you an actual decision you have to make. During those rest intervals. What's the benefit of keeping your armrest on high? Because you want to keep your armor slots. So in this case, if you spin all four of your armor slots, they're done until your next long rest. So you won't be able to reduce any damage here on out with armor. It feels important to reduce this damage. Yeah. Cool. And then you would only be at 3 out of 6 hit health points, so you'd still want to be at half health. That's fine. Or you would just be at 4 and a 6 health points if you spend all four overslots. I think I spend all. Okay, cool. Yeah. You said four out of six. Yeah. So you'll take opposites. You'll be at two out of six. You'll take two damage out of the six that you can take. And then you'll have zero. You'll use all four of your numbers. You have zero hormones. Left. Did everyone kind of understand that? Yeah, I think so. But it'll probably need to be explained again once it's relevant again. They just smash your head. And you're going to take it, just bang the back of your head. And then you feel a net that gets wrapped around your shoulders. And then they start padding your clothes and reaching into your pockets and things like that. It is now your turn. And the mechanics of D and D, you'd basically be grappled right now. Hold on. Can I? Tell me. How this works. So action bonus option move. Yeah, totally fair. Basically your combat flow. I'll just pop this into your chat that you have. It. Nearby. So the simple rules section is you're gonna. Actually, that's more about normal rules. Simpler combat is really what you want to be. I thought I had in here, like, the three steps, but, I mean, it's basically do a. Where the heck is it? Sorry. You. Have simpler combat. Yeah. And I thought I had in there the flow. Of the action itself. I just have the rest. Okay, let me add that in there. Because I actually forgot. Combat flow. Basically, you have the spotlight right now, is what Dagger Heart likes to say. And you do whatever you want. You can move from near to a far range, which you don't want to do. You can try to. In this case, you would probably want to try to break their grip so you'd roll against a strength roll, and that would be your action. So you've got like an action roll, a reaction roll, and then you can do something with people. If there were people there with you. And then your action can also be the stuff in your character sheet, like spending hope and things like that. Yeah. There is a no initiative. So you keep going, doing whatever you're doing, until you roll with fear, and then I get to go. Yeah. I guess. I'll have to. Use this feature. Of. My foam roll network feature to try to contact Aggie. Nice. Yeah. That's sick. I was just looking at that, too. Yeah, I feel like yes is the answer here. I do think it's going to be mangled in the city, just slightly less crisp than it would be in the forest. So go ahead and make that instinct roll. And, I mean, 12 is pretty high, so we'll just leave it as is, actually. 20 with hope. Sick. That's amazing. No. So you just receive. So, yeah, you can definitely shoot that message to Aggie. What would you say? I. Think I would try. To give. Like, I think Britt is two men. And, I mean, this was the stupidest thing ever that she just did, but tuned in enough to be like, okay, yeah, you're showing me where we're supposed to be. I think she's naive and that she's never left the forest. So, like, following people to get directions is like, oh, yeah, sure, Community, blah, blah, blah. No, it's going to hurt me. But tune in enough to be like, okay, we turn right, and then we turn left, and then we turn. So I think I just try to send a message that's like, here's where I am. You know what I mean? A very rough and dirty kind of direction. And then at the end it says, find a. Nice. That's just, like, directions. Find any? Okay. Yeah. I think that's reasonable to me. I don't remember if you have to spend a hope to use a feature or if you just make them at least according to what's in our class stuff. Do you have any skills? You have a hunter. Okay, see, we'll say this is, like your hunter experience. So I am going to make you mark a stress to do perfect recall of where you are. That's fine. I think she would be able to. Yeah, that would be normally what you would do. You would either spend a hope or a stress to use an experience and to add it to a role. So I guess you could choose to use Hope if you want as well, since you did roll without. Okay, cool. I think that. Would be. I think she would be able to do that. As a character. Sweet. And then I think I do try to. Break out of. Yeah, go for it. You just roll against strength, and I can test. So, good news is you rolled high enough. Bad news is I get fear, so it switches to me, so you break the hold. But as you do. So you just like you just skin your knee. And you see that they were able to reach out of your pocket and they pull out your receipt from the test. And you see the two big guys. And they saw it made a noise. By the way, these two guys have now made a single sound. So it's the big guy's. And. Yeah. So as you've turned around, she broke the hold of the two guys who ambushed her from behind while he was out in the main, distracting her and talking to her from the friend. So that's how I got, like, the real drop on her. And he turns around, he says, No. This has just been. You have nothing of value, did you? Did I give you nothing in the forest. Oh, my goodness. This is not even worth my time. I think she's immediately offended because she has many, many valuable things on her. Yeah, what do you think that she carries? Does she have any family heirlooms or jewelry? Yeah, I think she does wear a necklace. That is very important. To her family, but it's like a piece of wood. Maybe not to the. Outside. He's going to try to smash that necklace because the only jewelry he can see. So I'm going to roll against your evasion again. I should have connected. Can I connect this? I'll just roll public for this. On. So. We have plus two to this roll. Trying to beat your 12. That's going to be a three plus five. So super low. So he tries to reach over there and he misses. Nice, I think. I'm going to spend one more fear. To try again. You all can see my public fear token. That's my economy. Once that runs out, the bad guys can't do anything to you. Basically, okay. So he reaches a second time. In that time, he does grab it, and you can see he starts to turn to run away, and he's like, maybe this is worth something in the right circles. And the other two guys have just. You see them just, like, staring at the receipt. And they kind of feel like you can tell that there's a different energy. Between the two groups. And then they ended up. They end up starting to tear off in different directions. So you've got. I'm calling it a receipt. There's probably been a word for you. Receipt with your rank on it. The two guys. And you have your necklace. With going with Asia. Iggy. Well, okay. I'm going to start with Britt. What do you think you would do? Which one would you go after? Necklace. Okay? Dan. So he tears out into the main thoroughfare. And Iggy, let's go ahead and roll one more of the shortcut. Roles that you tried to roll earlier. And if you can roll a 12 or higher, Than nice. The shortcut was just long, so you end up popping up in front of him on the correct road. Just much later than you thought you're going to. And what meets your eyes is Brit, describe your I'll describe the guy. You describe what bread looks like. So you see this guy who's sort of short and he's got something in his hand and he's looking over his shoulder and kind of like terror to Iggy's eyes, running from Brit. Who is. What's. What's Britt's vibe right now? I think Britt is. Out of sorts, but also she's kind of terrifying. I feel like hair is flying. And she's, like, running after him. But also she's a turtle person, so I feel like she looks like she's going. Like her body is moving as though she's going very slow, but actually, she's going pretty fast. The movement is very strange. It looks slow. But she's mad. Yeah. So her face is showing pretty clear age. That's what you see. Iggy, what do you do? How far? Up. Is he from? Yeah, Dagger Heart. Uses the ranges of very far, close near in melee or some shit like that. I think he's close. He's probably 30, 40ft away. You just popped out, like, one block over, and he's coming out from the alleyway headed towards you. And he. Has a van? No, I think it's still looking at his shoulder. So you could close ground if you want to get closer before he notices you. I mean, it's like more. Of like if. I realizes that. Yeah. You might not even know at this point. I don't know if. He knows what's going on. So I think. He would just stop. Still. Okay? I think he would ass. Ess the situation. A little bit more, okay? Britt, go ahead and you can close to his distance with an action roll, and then you can do whatever you need to after that. He's not that far away. So I'm still trying to figure out what to make you roll for in Dagger Heart. Yeah. What, do you want me to roll in the distance? Yeah. I would do, like, agility is pretty. That would be, like, if you want to tackle him. All in one. And get your stuff back. We can just do that in one roll. That's amazing. It's with fear, but you've got more than enough. So what's going to happen is you reach over and you hook his foot. You go into this big tumble and you start rolling on top of each other and you're scraping your head bangs across the ground. You're going to take a stress from this action. I do have a shell. Do you have a shelf? You also have four armor slots that you don't have any more of. So you're at 6 out of 6 stress. Which means any more stress you take goes directly to your hit points. Okay? But you are able to tangle them up pretty good. And I think that happens directly under your feet, where bread. Is wrapped this guy up, he's like, hey, help. She's crazy. Anything. At this point. Like, did she? See him. No. I feel. Like grit. In my mind. It's like. The mom. Ent. Okay? This is a specific reference, but in the movie Avatar, Have stone, sort of arrowhead, like daggers. And I feel like she's sort of, like, on top. Breathing. Like animalism? Yeah, kind of like tucked up against. No, she does not. Say anything. But the emotion is obvious. Well, I think iggy does this. Awkward. Nothing to see here. And. Just plops down on. A rock. He is. Not engaging. At all. Especially. If britt looks like. She's in charge. Of the situation. Okay? Let's cut over to Aggie. Probably should have done that before we resolved. Or over that next. I forgot that y'all did the mycelium thing. Well. Yeah. True. I think she's gonna get the message. And I feel like some of that stress chaos is coming through in the message, I think so. So I think Aggie's gonna turn. To. Yeah, loan, ignatius. I think Brit's in trouble. Can you guys help? And then she's just gonna start taking off. Not really checking to see if they're following, just hoping that they are. I kind of feel like in my mind, Britt moves like a Ninja Turtle, but Aggie moves somewhere between the Ninja Turtle and the Pillsbury Doughboy. Okay? And then if they do fall, then she'll. I mean, pass along the message, basically. Also, keep an eye out for AD I don't know what's going on there. But family. We need to find them. Yeah, I think lomi. After they take the last shot with Val. And it feels a little bit. And is Abby took like, two or three shots during the game. And. He's like a very close talker when he know those kind of people. He's up with some of the servers who are, like, cleaning things up and stuff. And it's like, let me tell you, you're the real hero. And then he hears that, and he's gonna snap him out of it and he's gonna follow. Down the stairs, I guess, and out the building. As the camera pans away and Lomi turns around, the server just looks in with. Like I hate first day. Ignatius, what are you doing? Hiding in the dark Hiding in the dark Looking like a grim reaper. It was a little spooky. Are you following? Are you? So Aggie's shouted that Brit's in trouble. Can you help? And her and Lumi have taken off. Yeah. Advantages is with him. Yeah. Okay? Then I think with as good of a direction as you got from Britt's message, and unless you feel like Aggie would have trouble remembering or translating that into practice, that you're able to find them pretty easily, and you probably come around the corner with Britt having her knife to the throat. Of a guy on the ground. And you see that maybe. 100ft in front of you. What do you get? I. Think she's gonna see that Brits a little roughed up. That combined with the message. I think she's gonna go up right next to her. Like closer. And. Oh, my gosh. Are you okay? Do you need help? I think. She's just over top of whatever with the knife, and she's like. He took my pendant. And I feel like that means something. I don't know. Up to you, but I feel like that's something. Obviously. I think she would at least know the significance to you. If nothing else. I'm not opposed to the idea of them is easy. For reasons. That I have having. One thing that doesn't make sense with the rest of their clan lore and everyone having a pendant from a tree that they chose at some point in their life. And it's, like the one thing that you always keep with you and doesn't die or change. I'm almost picturing, like, a petrified acorn shell or something. I want it to be from a tree, so an acorn shell is fine. Bark would have been cool, too, or I'd be saying, like, petrified wood. Kind of. Yeah. Where it's, like, dead, but not. You know what I mean? Because that's such a value? Yeah, it's at least separated. If it's bar just bark dead, it's not rotten. Maybe representative of something. Yeah, no longer growing, for sure. Can I agree on that? Okay? Yeah. So she's got her, then you would have some connection to that. Does he still have it? She snatches it. No. Gave him right back. It was just a misunderstanding. She is going to glare at. What was his name? Azure. Azure. She's going to glare at Azure. What the hell, dude? Would love to talk. Kind of scared. Too. Talk, he splits his throat. Death comes for us all. The one inevitable truth. Guy. Can you imagine? That would be awesome. He just kind of puts his finger on the dagger and tries to sort of lift it gently away. I'm not going rich. Can I just a little space. Why would we trust you? Well, clearly I'm outnumbered now in my opinions have left me. We could break his leg. Companions. What companions? Where did they go? Probably to go try to take the test next week because. Talking under the blade. Just a little space. Does he have anything on him that's visibly valuable? At all. Or that. He's got a pocket watch that's tied to a button. I think nature's coming over, just rifling through. Or are you assuming that? Yeah, I think I. Ripped off the pond. To watch and I say take something of mine. I take something of yours and then I just walk away from him. Yeah, he also had some other pouches and things, but that one would be the easiest. I think if she walks away, Aggie's going to put her foot on his chest to make sure he's not getting up until he's done answering her question. Okay, so Brittany has to cool off. How you keep some pen. Got it. Ignatius Lomi. Are y'all. What's the energy in ae too? I guess. If you're even noticing he was there. No, you. Go. You. Go. Let me get there a little later, but kind of catches the idea of this situation out of breath. And is walking up and going, Oh, we got a guy who's not wanting to talk anymore. That's interesting. Does Lomi have suspenders? Yeah. Is he aware of stuff on, you know, like, his pouches and things? Yeah. Yeah. It's like. It's thick. It's a thick belt. Listen, listen. You may paint me as the villain, but I'm not the one out here squandering my chance on the week before. The biggest week of your lives. Drink in 2aM you deserve this irresponsible. And, yeah, did I get a little carried away. I didn't realize. A family heirloom. Well, I guess I probably knew, but I just wanted to sell it because I'm broke, Spot. You deserve. Wait. Sorry. You're opinion. What? I said sorry. What? Yeah. I mean, no one does. Yeah. Yeah. You know why? You do deserve this. Thing. And what do you think themes deserve? Well, I've already lost my chance to do the one great thing everyone in this country wants to do. So you can just send me to the frontier. Oh, wait. Already here? Britt. Did he take anything else? You missing anything else? Yeah, my receipt, my ticket, whatever. They were idiots. Gonna put more weight. Okay, okay, okay. Where is it? It doesn't matter where it is. You know nothing. I guess I'll see you in the Thieves Guild tomorrow. We don't have themes going on. No, I said that maybe I should start one. Bring out our short staff like hold on his neck. The receipt is worthless. They just were sad that they didn't pass their entrance exam. I convinced them that if they helped me, Helped me to take over the opportunity that someone else is clearly squandering by staying out so late before the first day of classes that they deserved it more than the person who they. They got the. The receipt from. That. That's not how the loom knows who you are. It doesn't mean anything. It's worthless. It's a piece of paper. They're from Septal. They don't know any better. But you know better. I know what's valuable. So what do you need now? How was a long time ago. Maybe you didn't get accepted for something along the same way you didn't get a center because of your attitude and the way you behave right now. Maybe there's something test we need to do out for a reason. No, it's just stupid. That's got to be an intercession line. That's funny. He just kind of. He's not like, he's definitely intimidated by the girl video, but he's also not scared of you. He's not actively trying to run away or anything, but he's also just like, all right, what are you going to do to me now? So we're just going to stay here all night? Did you study at all? We have a week. You have a week. All right. That's what I thought when I went through it. And look at me now. Like I said, I'll see you here in a week. You don't think we can study up in a week? How long did it take to study for a test? Well, 20. 20,000 is a pretty big number. About the same time with a broken rib video. Why'd you do that? And do you want a roll? Just to have a role. To see how much damage you can do, but I'm totally good with breaking his ramp with the meat glove. Yeah, for sure. With fear. It might take a little stress from swinging, a little extra exertion. Had to bend over a little more, and he thought he would. Tenor. Nice. Yeah, dude. That would have hurt him. A little drunk. And swung. A little awkward. That would have put him on the brink of death. So he is no longer. Yeah, he's pitiful under your foot. Now the Aggie's gonna take her foot off. Can I scooch his over to the wall and props himself up? He's just not really looking at you anymore. Damn. Only. Now. It's a hit. Yeah, it sure was. Do we need to get this for Citi back or can we actually told us that? I think I've gotten a bit out of hand. I think it's time for me to turn in, that's for sure. All right. Britt. We doing? Everything you need. And I guess we should all walk each other back to the dorms now, right? And double check that there's nothing important that would. There's no fine patch. She's just double checking it. I think. Let's go. Forget the receipt. I'll be fine. All right. I think Eggie's gonna put her either. Is Britt someone that would want her round her or like, just hold her? Question. Which one? Of your friends took the receipt. Coughs up blood. The names. You can't really say them out loud. They're signed. I guess nickel would be the closest. It just rings the piss entice. I guess it's tus and dykl. But it's. I mean, it's. It's. It's. It's a language of. Ah. I think she, like, lifts up his hand to try to sign it. He's like. If. I get bourbon enough. Where he could be. Like it was. Then. No, I don't think so. Britt might have a chance to recreate a couple of the signs. Any. Time back. I don't know what that is. I guess. I can keep an eye out for them. But we just go to bed. How. Loyal are you? Lackeys. Are they gonna come back here for you? Like, can we just wait? No, they're not gonna. No one ever does. He gets up and starts, like, hobbling down the road. Wonder why that could be. Anyway. Okay, so any other pit stops on the way back from. I think I'm just gonna. I'm going railroad y'all at this point, the knights turned in, and you work your way back to your bunks. And we can call it there tonight. I didn't need to. So, like, this is three sessions? We're through. One day. We're doing great. Yeah. I was not expecting to go to the lounge tonight, but I thought it would. It was still worth it. From, like, a campaign perspective. Are we still thinking, like, seven sessions is reasonable? Because depending on how you all are enjoying your characters, The milestones that I have could be after 10 sessions or after two sessions. Yeah. If you like your characters, then. Then I can plan for, like, eight or nine sessions. But there's at least, like, two things that you need to still do at school. At least that I. That I've thought of. You can obviously go with whatever you want. And then there's things outside of school that you also probably need to do. And so each of those is probably at least a session. So it's like four or five worth of things. I'll play as many as you have. One. Cool. Unless we. I'm enjoying the world, and there's. There's a lot of, like, fun ways that we could go with it, but if we liked the short campaigns. I feel like, Luke, you built the world so, like, thoroughly. I feel like we need to get out there and see it a little bit. Cool. Well, then I will. I'll keep planning for nine that I could see. You know, like, let's just. Let's just. Just. Just tell me. Tell me when it's like five or less. I need to like that. Hey, we're on the final arc signal. Wrap it up in four. Got it. Got it. That. That would be very helpful. See how long this goes. Fine as me. I got nowhere to have. I have a. I have my process down now. I got into Obsidian for the first time and now I've got wikis and links and it's beautiful. Okay? Cool. We'll end tonight by doing the long rest together, because no one's done that. And then we will start the next morning with the the clax and call to go to class. So for a long rest you can fully clear all of your hit points for yourself. So you can choose two of the things you can choose two of these four things. First option. Is reset, your hit points to zero. Section option is clear. All of your stress. Third option is repair all of your armor. And fourth option is to switch out your cards for new cards. So those are your domain skills. Like the things you've been hoped for. You can choose two new ones instead of the existing ones you have. Interest. Ing. And then the other thing that you can do is you can gain a hope. If you prepare, which is just so you don't do any of the other things you prepare, you get hope. And that's like setting yourself up for the next day. And if you do it with another person and you give a good narrative, then you both get to hope. So, like in Britt's case. Probably got to clear some stuff. Prepared to find Lucky the next day. You gave to me. In hopes of using Hope to find Lucky. Exactly. Yeah. What are we prepared to team? We have, like, five of us. We have the whole. Now you can. You can max that, too. Good question. Play the game, right? Guys before we give it a Ben. Before we go to our respective dorms and stuff. Luvi and I are going to come up with a plan. But we have a plan. To ace this test at the end of the week. And you guys all seem pretty chill. So we'll let you all know. But don't tell anyone. This stays within the group. It's group of five people. I trust you all. Thank you. For having my back tonight. Yeah. I mean, well, we literally broke that dude's ribs. Yeah, it got a little out of hand. I'm not going to sugarcoat it. That was not my best moment. I think Aggie's gonna give him a hug. Maybe not your best. I deserved it, right? He assaulted someone and tried to steal from her. And it was brett. So, like, fuck that guy, right? Right. In the grease, if you will. Lumi, I think you and I should. Make a plan to find Lucky tomorrow. He beat my map. Can your maps track Lucky? Well, I guess we can use it to mark up serious locations. Hi. Lumi. So for tomorrow. Val did say something about having to trade it, like a story or something. I think we should just trade him a story about how you heroically saved. Heroically saved Britt. I mean, you just breaking someone's wrist. How attached are you to that little trophy you got? That pocket watch. It's yours if you want it. I think that might go along nicely with our story. Cheat. Hands over. I think we got some. I think we got something to barter with here. All right. Did we use Iggy's math? To mark search locations to find Lucky, we'll use the story. And the clock is bartering. And we'll meet up here. We'll meet up after class to search. And if we find lucky, does anyone else want to come with us to find luck? Y. I got a feeling. That you could just put an ear to the ground and hear where he is on came and that kid just won't shut his trap. That's a good point. You're going to be feeling like. You're inviting me. So tomorrow we find Lucky. Tomorrow we find Lucky. We barter for the study guide. And we ace the exam. This Friday. Cool. I think that works. I know it was a fake test and fake study guide, but this guy's got to know something. It's got to help us out a bit, at least. It sounds like it's going to be pretty thorough. I think he just created a study guide that he's used to doing these kinds of things, so if anything, I think it gives us an advantage. Total. Ly agree. I'm updating the long rest stuff right now with actual stuff from the actual rules, not what AI says. We can switch our loadout, right? Yeah. And you can hold on to two of those, right? Correct. And then there's actually a little bit more options in there about when you can gain more. And if you haven't chosen your subclass yet, like, at any point that you all feel you're ready to do so, that should give you some new skills. And that's just a button and foundry. That we can talk about later if we want to as well. Okay? I cleared my stress. I don't know if. That was. Yes, that was a good play for. So I'm going to share it again right now. It might be something you're already looking at. So there's that top section. You can swap any domain cards in their loadout for cards, then choose two of the so like one to one. However many cards you have in your vault, you can swap them. And I think you default to any domain cards in your domain, so like any of those that pop up in boundary, you can use. Then. Holly, I still owe you some custom domain cards. But I haven't done that yet. I like how. The rest is. Like each player is, like, describing the way they're at. Yeah, it's a good mechanic. It's like a gritty, not gritty way to make rest actually mean something. Cool. You got a little tutorial lesson in dagger. Hard on. Look at those sleeves. That's amazing. You go to new york? Yeah. On. Sunday. And. They just had. A blizzard. And I don't own any. Winter apparel. Anymore. Such a californian. Brandy. Kind of feel like Iggy. Thanks, guys. So fun. When's the next time, okay? I'm very impressed by your. Accent. And I don't know. How long? You've been keeping that. In your arsenal. Which accent? Luke's yeah. I was like, yeah, so good. I literally. Have to plug. A nostril every. Time I use. And. You can just pull that. Out like nothing. It goes in between Boston. And new york italian. It kind of goes between. It. Works. Both of them. At least you stay in the same city. I can't even stay at the same continent. And. Norway. You wouldn't think that these two things are similar, but then they are suddenly. This. One is easier for me to hold on. To in a lot of other. Books. Thank you. I appreciate that. All right, well, then for us, we probably can. Do no earlier than March 5th. I probably should not do with this because I. The next week's not showing up for me, for you. It is coming up. Just I'm going to be in San Juan on an overnight. When? Christina, when's your birthday? Fourteenth. Bye day. Following me. Not messy. But following me. Like the ninth week. So you're talking about the 9th. Holly. Yeah. Like the 19. Th and 13th. I don't have anything. Okay? Shoot. Hold on one second. I am totally free that week as well. Trophy. Don't ruin it for us. Ob. I can't do that whole. Week. Okay. What about the next week? I'm sorry. My in laws aren't going to be in town. The whole week. But y'all feel free to play without me. I can always be. Recovering from my injuries. Let's do one on the 9th. And then if that works for you, John. 50. 50. Intense matter, or is it just always like that? It's just always like that, okay? So 9th or 10th. And once someone makes plans on one of those two dates, then we don't do that. We did the other one. But playing on the 9th. First. And Sophie. I'll send you some stuff. Yeah, that one's great. Okay, okay. All right. Bye. Bye. What's up with your calendar? Do you have any of my stuff since I updated my phone? I don't think so. You might have to unsubscribe and resubscribe. Basically reset my fc view. It should have been through Google, so I wouldn't have thought that. What do I know? All I know is it would basically reset all my FCB stuff, so I wouldn't be surprised if it affected something. Man. They'll really let me walk Sophie into a nasty spot there. 's going to get going. I was waiting for an opening to run after her. Yeah. And I was looking at. The communication thing that we had to. But again, there was just not a good. I was thinking of how long they had been on that little journey and the timing. It probably like with Val go to sleep. You and Lumi and Ignatius would have had time to go wander out at some point. So you probably were already out of there if we hadn't divided a cut back. I was so determined to get to around a combat both for myself and for us. I didn't want to distract it. Switch the spot. Light. No, it worked out. Actually might be this on your computer. Yeah, it's just easier to do. To share the calendar that way. I also realized after we had talked about the whole climbing trees and stuff. I do have wall walk. Which means I could walk up and down trees, which I totally forgot. That's a cool effect that. Exactly. When I picked it, that's exactly what I was thinking. Up and down the tree. Yeah. But didn't even think about it. That being said, I don't think necessarily would have changed anything because Forest versus City. Whole different. Just some flavor text. I also need. So I have a thing called beast form. Which lets me transform into creatures. Of my tier or lower from the beast. Formless. I need that list. Know how I can turn into. Because when I was thinking about running after her, panther became, like, really fast. I'm definitely good with us doing whatever. The official beast form list is. But I'm also really like the idea of taking the same status and just changing the beast to be what would be in the forest or however you imagine your character doing that type of stuff. I'm probably just going to Google Dagger hard beast form list if you wanted to do any pre digging. Allegedly. I should have gotten my referral for Frontier. Yeah, Josh referred us, so we got his rates. Oh, that frontier. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah, I'm going to fly now. Well, I know just. Silly boy. So. What do you mean? You should have gotten it today. That was already processed. We took over their account. Which means we should have not been validated for a referral. Because I pestered the shit out of the customer support. At some point they fucked it up. And so now we got their low rate. And Josh and I will both get $250. Oh, nice. Very nice. Allegedly. We're not going to believe until the center counts. Yes, sir. Oh, hey, you know how people are starting fires. The other session. Apparently I have a thing that can start a campfire at will. Poor will. Campfires are the best. I did see that in your character sheet after I was like, He didn't check her. She. I don't. Know that she would have played with fire very much or been inclined to play with fire. Fair. Y got intense. Yeah. It's always been. It's kind of a fun character for me to see. So if you play. Because the other one's been really goofy and Laz. She plays her characters. She method acts her character. So sometimes. Are you actually upset in the zone? But yeah. I need to. Need to break brit. Get her. Get her. Have some. Fun. I might just stay suspicious the whole time. I was so ambitious. With this session. How much do you think was going to happen? But I wasn't sure. I knew that the combat was going to take. Actually, like, pretty good. Like 20 minutes. It was fairly quick combat. Kind of. Other reason I didn't want to pull you all in to close the encounter out. I didn't want to do that the whole night. It's about as much as I realistically thought we were going to get to. But I really want you all to take the test. But there's so many things that I want to do before the test. To make it fair for you all, kind of. Yeah. That didn't sound good. Okay? I also probably shouldn't have given you all long rest. I was out here I didn't want to do. Because you stayed out so late. I was only meaning. I think it was going to be like a short rest. Yeah, short rest. Yeah, when you said long rest. I caught these in long grass. Even though you'd been emphasizing how late it was all the time. But I'm like. If I say anything, it's like the kid who tells the teacher that they didn't collect the homework. Yeah, I can't do that. Stinker. Can't portray my crew like that. Stinker. Love you. Love you. Take care. Okay? Completely unrelated, but I'm going through all my tabs because I have a million open and I have bought things. Since I've opened these tabs, I'm closing out tabs. And finding other tabs that I have not dealt with yet. If we are doing a self serve cap wall. We do know what they're going to be. They're kind of a little dog tag. Gy things. I'm like 15 or higher by it. Because I kind of want to make it out of wood. And burn it. With, like, a little stencil. I just don't have legible. That one would be versus. That. 's really nice. If you feel like you want to keep them. For longer. Than $30. A couple of labels. Crazy. Yeah. Also fills. Space or quantity? 3D. It's nicer quality. You can try 3D printing. These take? Two to three weeks to get here. I'm glad to be your project for the next. Two weeks. Yeah. If we're not happy with that, then we order them. Dang it. I keep bringing to transcribe. Click any notes. So annoying. Yeah. I think we can just put White Wolf bridal veil and 805. Prestige that I think 805. I know it's going to be 8 to 5 cerve. But I like that805 is a little more. Broad. I can print several, but I was thinking I could do. The side. And then. From the side view, like two colors. This color and then the color behind the numbers. So if this was white. And this was. Black, for example. And the number eight would be in white. The O would be and white. The five would be white, and the outside would be even black. I can also do film designs or something. I get the numbers being different than the surrounding thing, but I don't understand the two layers. I guess would be the back. This is the front. It doesn't matter. The numbers are. Different colors. To like printing it, like. Hand was. Was black, and my fingers were going like that, so you can see the black between. The contrast. Ing next steps. Holly will go to the ATM to get cash for buying bootlegged versus. What's the big difference between short rest and long rest? Assume you don't get nearly as much from a short rest. It's like you can only choose. You only choose. Two and you have to roll for stuff versus getting it all. You spend a hope to get back stress or you. Feel like the hopes could disappear so fast. Which I don't like. Once you start using them, I'll start letting you roll more to potentially gain them more. But it is either giving me or giving them. I do kind of like the little. By using the fear. I can just do whatever. But you know how much karma you've built up for bad things to happen on accident or whatever, because you can see the amount of fear. You roll a D4 plus your your skill to heal. It's all rolling D4s for stuff instead of guaranteed. That can be obviously a pretty big switch from clearing six stress. I was just looking at my. I forgot. I think it was like, the evolution or whatever. For my beast form. It's like spend three hope. To do something minor. I was like, what?
