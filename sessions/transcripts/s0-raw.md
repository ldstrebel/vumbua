**Luke S:** Uh, yeah, you were a turtle combined with the mushroom. Turtle mushroom thing.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Literally mine too.  
**Holly Strebel:** That's  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I'm telling you there's like we we think the same or something.  
**Holly Strebel:** crazy.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I don't know.  
**Luke S:** You need to read some of Christina's books.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** This has happened like multiple times. I feel I feel like this happened in our very first one too.  
**Luke S:** That is so funny.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** like when I was like kind of like surfer hippie and you were sort of like a similar like animal.  
**Luke S:** Yeah,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** just kind of like  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I just feel like it's we've like lined up so many times. But again,  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I'm truly happy to change  
**Luke S:** No, it's actually I mean it works great because you're you're from the same clan.  
**John Hagey:** This was fate.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** my  
**John Hagey:** This was This was decided by fate.  
   
 

### 00:00:40

   
**Luke S:** So there I  
**John Hagey:** I said this was fate. We're not changing anything.  
**Luke S:** agree. I agree.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** You can't fight fate.  
**John Hagey:** Fate was destiny.  
**Luke S:** And and you just defined your clan so well. Like it would have been one if you'd have said I look like a I'm I'm a I'm a bird person and she's like well I'm I'm a turtle person then we have been like how do we rectify this? But no uh the the turtle mushroom folk who live in the swamp.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Turtle mushroom guy.  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** So um obviously there's there's a few things that y'all learned about your clan. So I'm going to ask you to improv like how you might know each other is is where this is going.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**Luke S:** So I'm just giving I'm talking for a minute so you can think about that.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**Luke S:** Um, but yeah, so y'all your home is inside this huge fossilized megaplora like somewhere between the Pandora tree and uh like hobbit holes is how I've kind of picturing the forest.  
   
 

### 00:01:34

   
**Luke S:** Um and they the interest like what you have been taught what your your family history is all about is that things must die and the the legends the lore that you have been taught to as like a harrowing tale is when things stop dying we start dying. So it's like either we as a people contribute to the death and decay of  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**Luke S:** the world um and therefore like we die at a normal rate or we all die because nothing starts. So this is weird like weird relationship with life and death that's not so it's not normal. It's like scary when things stop dying and that's why your clan has been really concerned lately because things have started to not die and and the histories like there's  
**Luke Foreman:** I  
**Luke S:** no um recollection or like you you don't really know  
**Luke Foreman:** think  
**Luke S:** anybody in other clans. uh the forest has kept you segregated from them. And the the lore often talks about how that is this the purpose of the forest is to keep you apart from the world because when the world comes things stop dying.  
   
 

### 00:02:46

   
**Luke S:** Um and so whether it was because the forest is on the coastline and that's just where kind of harmony and its its fleet of explorers landed. Um they very quickly found this forest. I mean it is like a very bizarre forest like a combination of petrified fauna that you wouldn't find anywhere else in a normal um like a normal coastal region. And so there was uh very soon you started getting like you very connected to the network of trees even even the way that you all transported yourself is very is the same. Um, and so you were starting the elders very quickly learned that there was there was new people on the shores  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** and you're not war folk.  
**Luke Foreman:** You  
**Luke S:** So you were left with the choice of do we do we fight or do we try to  
**Luke Foreman:** know,  
**Luke S:** like find a middle ground um because now the forest isn't doing what it's done for us for like hundreds and hundreds of years anymore. It's not keeping us separate. So you didn't the elders didn't respond decisively which meant that um Harmony started realizing something was special about the the clan.  
   
 

### 00:04:05

   
**Luke S:** And so, um, like last cycle, maybe two cycles ago, a a a group of of, um, humanoids came led by a a man in like a what seemed to you to be a very sterile outfit. It didn't have any moss growing off of it. It had no holes in it. It was just very bland and had metal on it. Y'all don't wear metal. It's not really a thing that your clan does. And um there was meetings with the elders and then um the the man started bringing things that the elders were now distributing to the clan and then it became like you became like the fire brigade. You were starting to just try to destroy the forest around you to get it to die. Um and the last cycle a few of the like the young from your clan went to the school. This is not the first time that your like your clan has now had some sort of relationship with harmony. There's like a trade that they come and they seem to take the soil and the roots and the bark and the stone and you not really they're not really sure what they're looking for.  
   
 

### 00:05:12

   
**Luke S:** Neither really are you.  
**Holly Strebel:** There are you.  
**Luke S:** Um but in return they're giving you like weapons to destroy your home which is exactly what you want. And so now the next generation has come and it's now time once again and the the the um the paperman has offered uh much more of the mcelium clan can now join the vooma academy this year and the two of you elected to join. So um this is the question part. How would you think like based off of I mean I'll kind of I'll tee you up a little bit more. Um, let me see which one of you whose results I'm reading right now. Um, so Christina, what you would know about Sophie's character is probably that um, they are maybe a little like the way I read your answer, Sophie, is like she they're a little bit outspoken. they might be a little bit um uncertain about their relationship with harmony harmony and maybe even like a little suspicious of it. And um Sophie, what you would know about Christina is um maybe that you kind of have had some gossip together about about Harmony and whether or not it's healthy for the clan, but she may not be quite as like aggressive as you at least how I'm reading your responses.  
   
 

### 00:06:46

   
**Luke S:** So, I don't know if that's helpful, but curious what you think about your characters now. I still think it's funny  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I know.  
**Luke S:** that  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** How would we know each other? I feel like our clan's not probably not that big, right?  
**Luke S:** correct. Yeah.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** probably everybody knows everybody  
**Luke S:** Like maybe Yes. Yes. Yeah. The other thing about the clans um is that every like the only way that you know about other  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** theoretically.  
**Luke Foreman:** That's  
**Luke S:** clans is um and this would have been how we would have justified you not being turtle people is that you um the clans like have basically a hostage exchange which is the bridal ceremony because the clans are slowly decreasing in size over time and so it's very much like a fallout bunker exchanged the bride and the groom to increase the genetic population of the clans so that you don't have really nasty stuff going on. Um, but like there's there's legends of your clans being in in the hundreds of thousands and and now it's in like the thousands or or tens of thousands depending on how big in the forest you define your  
   
 

### 00:08:01

   
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** M. Mhm.  
**Luke S:** clan.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I don't know. Christina, what do you think? How would we know each other?  
**Luke S:** Um, I feel like it would either be like distant relatives or like not super distant but like not siblings necessarily like maybe cousins or second cousins or it's like if there's like a version of like a school that like we were just kind of same grade or whatever, same age in the kind of growing up together. So like around each other, maybe not like best friends hanging out all the time kind of relationship, but know of each other and know like enough about each other that when we find out we're going to the same school,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**Luke S:** it's like makes sense they would connect a little  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**Luke S:** bit.  
**Luke Foreman:** Same year at turtle camp.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Same here at Turtle Camp. I like the idea of cousins, too. I think that's kind of what if we're both what if we're cousins and we're in the same year at school and for that reason we're not like super close because it's we've always been sort of like forced together as like you're the same age D but we obviously are similar in a lot of ways and connect on like a lot of things but not necessarily like you know, BFFs, I guess.  
   
 

### 00:09:35

   
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Does that make sense? I don't know.  
**Luke S:** Yeah,  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Thoughts?  
**Luke S:** like we go to school but we're very different groups which also spoken versus the  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Exactly. Yes.  
**Luke Foreman:** here.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yes. But we like know of each other maybe more than we would because we're cousins.  
**Luke S:** not  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** You know what I mean?  
**Luke S:** Yeah. Cool.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Great.  
**Luke S:** Um, awesome. So, let's uh I I'll I'll kind of rotate around and do this little intro with the other folks, but um I might come back to y'all and bridge into like how were how are y'all like role play being sent off to go to the academy and how you would kind of like um what you would tell each other and what you wouldn't tell each other basically. So, okay. Then the next um the next pairing let's see um it's funny. It's the spread is pretty funny. Um, I think I might flip the script a little bit and and Holly, maybe you after kind of having that baseline, what questions do you have about your clan?  
   
 

### 00:10:59

   
**Luke S:** Um, and what do you want to talk about and what do you want to keep to yourself?  
**Holly Strebel:** Um,  
**Luke S:** I'm very interested on on why you chose that  
**Holly Strebel:** I just had little time.  
**Luke S:** one.  
**Holly Strebel:** So, I'm open to change if it doesn't fit the rest of the storyline,  
**Luke S:** No, it's I trust me there.  
**Holly Strebel:** but I feel like I haven't played like a grumpy comedic  
**Luke S:** I went  
**Holly Strebel:** character. And so, that's kind of more the thought process of what I was I was kind of picturing  
**Luke S:** Okay.  
**Holly Strebel:** like when Exactly.  
**Luke S:** The mole in  
**Holly Strebel:** Exactly.  
**Luke S:** Atlanta.  
**Holly Strebel:** when you said Atlantis as you were talking I was like what is a character in Atlantis I haven't like feel like a played and yeah the mole and so yeah that's exactly what I was envisioning  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** That  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** was  
**Luke S:** Okay.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** was  
**Luke S:** Um,  
**Holly Strebel:** yeah  
**Luke S:** do you do you have any questions about what you would know about Harmony or um about your clan and what they kind of believe in their  
   
 

### 00:12:12

   
**Holly Strebel:** I guess I feel like I understand what our clan believes,  
**Luke S:** lore?  
**Holly Strebel:** but I guess I don't really know because they are not from within Harmony. Like do does do you think my character would know Harmony at all? Like would they just be completely like what the  
**Luke S:** No, no.  
**Holly Strebel:** heck?  
**Luke S:** And vice versa. Like there um you have had no contact. You've only had you you've only had that one like incident that kind of inspired panic  
**Holly Strebel:** Okay.  
**Luke S:** which makes it interesting for what your motives might be and whether or not they're approved. Like are your actions, you know, approved?  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** Are you gonna going run in a gade? Those would be some of the things that you can reflect on for your character.  
**Holly Strebel:** Okay. Um, yeah. I don't really know how he's gonna fit in this world, but we'll find out.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** John  
**Holly Strebel:** I don't know what you want me to share. I mean, I'm I can  
   
 

### 00:13:15

   
**Luke S:** Yeah,  
**Holly Strebel:** share.  
**Luke S:** I mean it's it's kind of like I mean there's a there's a couple of fun roleplay opportunities  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** to let if if we let the role play bring out the things like instead of us meta  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** talking about your background in in session one when you meet people you in that moment decide what to tell your friends or your potential friends and what not to tell. Um and and  
**Holly Strebel:** I think purely just because like I can't physically  
**Luke Foreman:** because I can physically  
**Luke S:** that's  
**Holly Strebel:** roleplay it and I feel like it would be a very physical reaction for this character to just be in like I basically from like not below the ground like he's going  
**John Hagey:** What do you mean you can't physically  
**Holly Strebel:** to be very overwhelmed at all times of like being on land. So, just yeah,  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** I feel like that's going to be like something maybe I can't physically draw out,  
**John Hagey:** You were a theater kid.  
**Holly Strebel:** but  
   
 

### 00:14:15

   
**John Hagey:** We believe in you and I believe you can do it through a computer interface. I think you can do this.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah,  
**Holly Strebel:** okay.  
**John Hagey:** Or at least I want to see you  
**Luke Foreman:** I think  
**John Hagey:** try.  
**Luke S:** Yeah,  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** we can talk more about um how how they're reacting, but yeah, it it's it would be very difficult to blend in.  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah, there's I I don't think there's going to be much  
**Luke S:** Um that said like yeah there is same as the other  
**Holly Strebel:** blending.  
**Luke S:** clans there is still like the the the blood exchange like your clan would also participate in that. It's the only time that you would ever talk to other women and I think um most often it seems like the river sect are the people who you are getting young people from and uh that is done by they just jump into the water and then you pull them down and your people go to shore and there's no like you don't talk to anyone. There's nothing else that happens.  
   
 

### 00:15:15

   
**Luke S:** It's just at a certain time every year someone is in the water and you like your clan's job is to bring them before they drown and vice versa someone in your clan walks out of  
**Luke Foreman:** Perfect.  
**Luke S:** the water never basically to be seen again.  
**John Hagey:** Damn,  
**Holly Strebel:** Okay.  
**John Hagey:** that's wild.  
**Luke S:** Okay. So that that could be another um way to you know you might you might have been in that ceremony at some point and then decided to do something. So like it wouldn't be the first time above land or they might have been curious in the past and sort of like gone rogue  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah,  
**Luke S:** before.  
**Holly Strebel:** that's that's a good point actually.  
**Luke S:** Okay.  
**Holly Strebel:** Okay.  
**Luke S:** Um sweet. So then let's keep on on the clan on the clans. Everyone liked the clans. Uh almost everyone. John, same questions. Um, what are you curious about?  
**John Hagey:** Oh, like in general about  
**Luke S:** Yeah, kind of same thing.  
**John Hagey:** everything.  
   
 

### 00:16:21

   
**Luke S:** You know, I'm sort of letting y'all decide how much you want to play close hold and how much you want to reveal.  
**John Hagey:** I want to know the relationship of my clan and the uh the real what's it called my  
**Luke Foreman:** Are we  
**John Hagey:** yeah harmony uh because as I understand it my clan provides the  
**Luke Foreman:** ready?  
**John Hagey:** ability to work the batteries and help create them and I'm wondering how that relationship works  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** because like my clan provides the heat the the fire for  
**Luke S:** Yeah. Yeah. So, this is interesting.  
**John Hagey:** Right.  
**Luke S:** Um, and actually, uh, Luke, this gives you a hook as well if you want to play off this. Um, so, John, your clan is,  
**John Hagey:** Sick.  
**Luke S:** uh, is is born in the volcanoes. You you live in heat. you like your whether you're your ancestor reflexer or not.  
**Luke Foreman:** What weapon?  
**Luke S:** Um like you're half obsidian and or at least that's what the lore tells you you should be. But as long as you've been alive, the furnaces and the fires have been embers.  
   
 

### 00:17:30

   
**Luke S:** They're still hot. They're still like when the marriage ceremony happens, there's still like months of acclimating before someone can live inside your inside the volcano home. Like I'm kind of imagining a like like your campaign, this big mountain with terrorist tears in there and they have to live at the very top of the volcano because getting too close to the core is is going to just melt them. Um but uh there there's legends of a time that the volcano like truly burned and was a source of fire. And when the the harmony walkers and ships came, um the volcanic isles are off of the continent proper, you know, like Hawaii Island situation. Um and so they they your clan was very hard to miss because it's a volcano belching smoke. Um,  
**John Hagey:** The f\*\*\* was  
**Luke S:** and so these while you still never talked to other clans and your  
**John Hagey:** that?  
**Luke S:** your ancestral lore has told you that it's a bad idea that like um when the clans went away, but your your lore tells it a little differently.  
   
 

### 00:18:40

   
**Luke S:** What your Lord tells you is that there was a time of of great heat and great flame and then when we stopped talking to other people, the flames went cold and they have been cold since. And when harmony came, the flames started getting hot again. Like what used to take you um you know a boulder to heat up a pot of water to boil it is now taking like a pebble. And that has just happened since Harmony has arrived. They have like reinvigorated the volcano. I think your whole clan is very excited about Harmony and have been very active in the like the community. So you've you've sent now along with the Mycelium clan, you've sent clan members to Vimua Academy before. Um so far no one's come back, not really. But they've sent letters and stuff. They haven't disappeared off the face of the map. They just like your clan's trying to integrate into that society. And um the the paper man who came to you was was happy to meet you, but he wasn't like blown away by your clan.  
   
 

### 00:19:43

   
**Luke S:** Your clan was definitely more excited that fire was coming than they seem to be about like the [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Bloods]]. So, um, yeah, I think your your of all the clans, your relationship's definitely the most like normal trade trying to integrate than compared to the rest of  
**John Hagey:** Okay. Um,  
**Luke S:** them.  
**John Hagey:** and then next question following up because I'm still trying to understand the relationship a little bit more is as I understand it, the trade relationship is they provide these types of batteries basically, but we provide labor for them when it comes to working like the iron and stuff that goes into them because like again the when I was reading it, they were saying like, oh yeah, these little crystal things are like little suns basically that we use because  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** again trying to understand my character as a whole.  
**Luke S:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** Like it sounds like my character is like,  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** "Don't trust those guys. They're providing a quote unquote false religion flame.  
**Luke S:** Sure.  
**John Hagey:** We need a real  
   
 

### 00:20:43

   
**Luke S:** Sure. Yeah. So, Harmony,  
**John Hagey:** flame.  
**Luke S:** what Harmony brings are is is like um I mean it's like petrol. It's like gasoline. They can you can put it into all these devices and it powers stuff.  
**John Hagey:** Yeah,  
**Luke S:** The only thing that your rocks do is get hot,  
**John Hagey:** got it.  
**Luke S:** which Harmony can use to make steam and other things, but it's it's a single use. But if you put one of the batteries, like one of these little um glass vials that glows with a white energy into this little machine to heat a kettle, it'll heat a kettle the same way as you putting a rock under it. Um, but that like right now that little gym,  
**John Hagey:** Ah\!  
**Luke S:** that little gym is more efficient than your rock is, but your rocks becoming stronger and stronger.  
**John Hagey:** Ah\!  
**Luke S:** And you think like basically this is um a generalized energy that can be repurposed for multiple machines, whereas your like the power of your clan is is hyper specialized on  
   
 

### 00:21:37

   
**John Hagey:** f\*\*\*  
**Luke S:** just making hot rocks. Um,  
**John Hagey:** yeah. We make hot rocks,  
**Luke S:** which Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** baby.  
**Luke S:** And and that those are like you you have an infinite resource of those to export it. You've never like there's at least no fear in your clan right now that if we give away all the stones the volcano will go dormant and you know we won't have our own in burn like the the magma always provides. Um, and so some there are some uses for these like hyper specialized stones, but it's kind of it the way that the trade relationship is building is that you're realizing that these are this is a common like you're not the only provider of these. Um, you've I think you've even learned some of Harmony have these like great families that also have these specializations. And whereas yours is is heat and warmth, some of the other specializations are things you can't even like conceptualize. These super rare resources that you don't know what they do, but are critical to how the air the air behemoths stay in the sky and how the walkers can move their legs.  
   
 

### 00:22:41

   
**Luke S:** Like earstones wouldn't help with any of that.  
**John Hagey:** All right. All I wanted to know. We'll flush it out  
**Luke S:** Cool.  
**John Hagey:** later.  
**Luke S:** Okay. Uh our family man  
**John Hagey:** Nice.  
**Luke S:** Um,  
**Luke Foreman:** Mhm.  
**Luke S:** I I wasn't sure if you were gonna stay with your thought of playing playing uh Brother Cousin again or if you were going to change it  
**Luke Foreman:** kind of going the other  
**Luke S:** up.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**Luke Foreman:** way.  
**Luke S:** Yeah. Yeah, it seemed uh it seemed pretty pretty grease  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** monkey.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, that's the goal. Kind of kind of bluecollar guy. Um, I was thinking a earth kin as the ancestry. So kind of like working down in the boiler.  
**John Hagey:** Oh, that's nice. Sorry,  
**Luke S:** Cool.  
**John Hagey:** I forgot to say my ancestry, but yeah, sorry,  
**Luke Foreman:** You what?  
**John Hagey:** I forgot to say my ancestry, but mine was the the  
**Luke Foreman:** Nice. Nice.  
**John Hagey:** emberkin  
   
 

### 00:23:38

   
**Luke Foreman:** So I was thinking earthken or maybe like a earthkin human split potentially. um but works the boiler of the city down, you know, blue collar union strong working the boiler, making sure the city's running on time. Um, you know, all the all the wealthy high folk in the castle, you know, they they pay us because who's going to who's going to have the trains run on time, you know?  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** We're more important than than they are really when you think  
**Luke S:** Gotcha. Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** about.  
**Luke S:** Yeah. But like they can't live without us.  
**Luke Foreman:** Right. Exactly.  
**Luke S:** Yeah. Yeah. And and I think like if if I'm reading it correctly, you've you have transferred with the academy. So the one thing that you would know that the other claims wouldn't know is um Harmony has a very very long history like thousands of years this has been going on. And um it's not quite the same way, but in if you've ever seen Mortal Engines, uh there's this basically there cities that eat other cities.  
   
 

### 00:25:00

   
**Luke S:** And there the the thing that people get the most excited about is is finding a new city to eat and consume its resources. That's not what Harmony does, but it has that same energy. Like the whole country revolves around finding new lands.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** And um and for as long as you can remember, well, how old do you think your character is?  
**Luke Foreman:** So I I want to ask a question about the academy. So, is the academy like like a high school like school age sort of  
**Luke S:** It it goes it's it's more like a trade school, but very specific job is to tra to train explorers.  
**Luke Foreman:** Okay.  
**Luke S:** So, you really only get one chance.  
**Luke Foreman:** Okay.  
**Luke S:** So, usually people come when they're best prepared.  
**Luke Foreman:** Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, that's what I was going to ask because I was going to say otherwise he's like a super super super senior situation like he is  
**Luke S:** Yeah. And he could be could be like, "This is my time. I I I now know enough about how the world works  
   
 

### 00:26:01

   
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah,  
**Luke S:** that  
**Luke Foreman:** I think he's in like an like the last whether it's like the last year or maybe something of that sort very much like in the apprentice ship, but like the the guy you're like in college like you you did something in between high school and getting here. You didn't come straight here. You might be older than the professor.  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** You're like You're like the 25 year old dude at boot camp.  
**Luke S:** Like  
**John Hagey:** Everyone calls you grandpa even though you're 25 years old.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So,  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** like not not like an old old person, but like older than than the majority of the explorers and maybe even older than some of the people he's learning from.  
**Luke S:** Okay, cool. Um, yes, that makes sense. So, like, yeah, maybe the question will be why is he changing it up if he's almost through his apprenticeship? Um, because being an explorer is uh is is is your life once you get on one of those vessels.  
   
 

### 00:27:05

   
**Luke S:** You don't you don't have a home anymore. You are like but you you are now one of the royals basically of society. Um, anywhere you go, your beer's paid for. Uh, they are the superstars.  
**Luke Foreman:** Okay.  
**Luke S:** Like you, you know, multiple cap famous captains names and which civilizations they've discovered. Um, but if he's that old, which which Earth can I don't know how long their lifespan is, but let's say it's like,  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** you know, I don't know that it's Elvin, but it might be oldish. And um whether it's you yourself or your parents or your grandparents, you can remember a time that Harmony was finding new civilizations all the time. And to be an explorer was like sort of a dime a dozen. And a lot and looking around the continent of Harmony right now, there's thousands of cities, like millions of people live there. It's it's huge. Um but it's been like 80 years since finding anything. the ocean. Like Harmony has the other thing that's that people tell about is Harmony gets closer over time.  
   
 

### 00:28:11

   
**Luke S:** Like islands that were once far apart upon discovery are now significantly closer in mileage to the Harmony Core than they were. And the Harmony Core like at some point um the sea was forced out and it just became a continental shelf. It's like opposite Pangia basically. Uh yeah, I see it. One second. Um, and so there is like a it's still no one's like worried, but there's still there's an undercurrent of like where where are are we the end of the world? And then the new world is found and the clans were found and everyone was like,  
**Luke Foreman:** Mhm.  
**Luke S:** you know, celebrations across the world like the war ended basically. Um,  
**Luke Foreman:** Really?  
**Luke S:** the other thing that happens at Harmony is um there's constantly like these e ether and nether beasts that are attacking the borders of harmony. And so some of the like lore and famous people went from exploration to like defense and military to keep the the continent safe basically. Um but upon the discovery of the second clan around the time the mcelium clan so the the ash bloods were discovered first and then the mcelium were discovered second and this has all been in the last like two to three years.  
   
 

### 00:29:25

   
**Luke S:** um the academy physically moves itself from where it last was to where the next exploration hub seems to be that they can train the explorers on the frontier basically. Uh so like you could move with it and have been a maintenance person at the academy. Uh there's some other things you can play off of.  
**Luke Foreman:** I think that's that's absolutely what it is.  
**Luke S:** John  
**Luke Foreman:** It's like a maintenance person on the academy and then move moving and seeing like a new reinvigorated buzz for there. There's finally like new things. Exploration is is on the table again sort of thing.  
**Luke S:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** And that kind of pushes him into a life that he thought didn't exist anymore. Was kind of over.  
**Luke S:** Okay. John, did you have something?  
**John Hagey:** Uh yeah, I was just wondering if there's a instory explanation for like why things move closer or is that just it just happens or like is that a thing that like people have looked into because they were curious about it or is that  
   
 

### 00:30:27

   
**Luke Foreman:** Thank you.  
**John Hagey:** just something that's so normal it's just like all  
**Luke S:** That is a good question to ask at the academy because it the answer depends on who you  
**John Hagey:** right  
**Luke S:** ask.  
**John Hagey:** let's get this game going I guess  
**Luke S:** Uh there there is a there is an answer uh or a lack thereof.  
**John Hagey:** it sounds like there's multiple answers  
**Luke S:** Either way. Yeah. Um okay. Anything else that you want to touch on, Luke?  
**John Hagey:** There's  
**Luke Foreman:** I think that works. I'm  
**Luke S:** Sweet.  
**Luke Foreman:** good.  
**Luke S:** So, um, you let's loop back around to the the clan the Funky Clan. Um, y'all are I don't I think it's kind of a mixed reaction that your clan mates give as  
**John Hagey:** heat.  
**Luke S:** you are the only two that are selected to go this year. Um, I don't I don't know if it'd be a competitive process or if there would be a lot of other people who wanted to go. I I kind of feel like not very many people really want to go, but y'all unless y'all feel differently.  
   
 

### 00:31:37

   
**Luke S:** Feel like based on the stuff that was in the uh survey, it sounds like they don't really want to go out and Yeah, they're pretty pretty home bodies. I would think it's maybe not super competitive.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**Luke S:** Like there might have been a couple other people, but not a ton. maybe. Okay. Yeah, that that makes sense with me. Um,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Me, too.  
**Luke S:** so what uh so it's it's it's basically the day that you're you are going to join the network and take the the highway, the mycelium highway over to the edge of the forest. Um, how do you all feel? Like I kind I kind of imagine it that one of you might have been out there first and then the other one is like and are you both equally eager, do you think, to get this adventure started? I'll go  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I think yeah. I mean,  
**Luke S:** first.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** correct me if you think I'm wrong here, Christina, but I feel like Luke, your read was that like I'm my character is potentially like a little bit more outspoken and kind of like aggressive more so than Christina's.  
   
 

### 00:32:50

   
**Luke S:** Yeah. I mean, maybe aggressive is not the right word, but like maybe more passionate.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yeah. and suspicious of Harmony as a whole.  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yeah, I think that in general,  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** yeah, I'd say my character is pretty eager, but like maybe not in the way that someone else would be eager to go. Like I think that there's a sense of like the call is coming from inside the house type of thing. Like a I'm going to go Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** Bring it in from the inside.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** like I'm going to go and like infiltrate is maybe strong,  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** but just like I'm I'm not going to be able to discover what I want to discover from the outside. So like I'm ready to like get started type of thing.  
**Luke S:** Mhm.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** And I think in general I see my character as being like a little bit more on the like cynical,  
**John Hagey:** They're  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** angry side maybe.  
   
 

### 00:33:46

   
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Um I don't know. Maybe if that's one of the reasons that like Christina and Ice characters aren't like best buddies cuz that's like maybe not who you are.  
**Luke S:** Yeah,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I don't know.  
**Luke S:** I was thinking mine was going to be pretty skeptical in like a more quiet like  
**John Hagey:** the same person.  
**Luke S:** suspicious but  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** So maybe that's maybe that's where we connect then.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** They're skeptical of each other and they don't realize the other one's a  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I mean,  
**John Hagey:** skeptic.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** clearly we're like we're from the same family. You know what I mean? Like there are things about us that are like very much the same,  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** but  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** yeah.  
**Luke S:** I think at least mine I think she's a little bit like quieter about the like I think she's wary of the uh harmony and all the tech and like stuff like that in like kind of an accusatory way of like they're they're responsible somehow but how and like going to uncover the conspiracy kind of way.  
   
 

### 00:34:47

   
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** And so,  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** okay, I'm gonna add I'm gonna add to our story here.  
**Luke S:** Hell yeah.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** We I'm going to say I've had the same thoughts and you and I in the  
**Luke Foreman:** And in the  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** past have sort of like gotten closer  
**Luke Foreman:** past,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** together over this. And I think we both have similar thoughts about like what's going on. And we haven't really like said that voiced this to like our families or anybody else, but we're both sort of like in like in cahoots on like something is wrong and we're about to go like save our families and save all of our people and we're going to do this, you and I, even though we haven't been like the best of friends in the past,  
**Luke S:** Cool.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** like we have a mission and we're going to do it together.  
**Luke S:** So, um, then I kind of imagine Sophie, your character might be ready to go first.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I think  
   
 

### 00:35:42

   
**Luke S:** Yeah. So, what do y'all say as And I think what we what we'll do maybe like a little bit later is we'll go retcon the  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** so.  
**Luke S:** family sendoffs. we'll do like a flashback for how the clan interacted. So,  
**Holly Strebel:** H.B.  
**Luke S:** we don't have to do that right now, but at least since y'all two are together, um, as soon as you, you know, I don't know what you what you might do to link hands or or join the network, but you pop out in the in the edge of the forest, uh, and you can see what you can only really define as like this word you've never heard called civilization coming. And the way that it manifests itself is a sprawling tower surrounded by huge buildings and all of these moving metal creatures that you've you can't describe. There's also just beasts that you've never seen before. And it is an assault on your senses. How would y'all react to that?  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I think my gut reaction would be to like grab Christina.  
   
 

### 00:36:50

   
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Does your character have a name?  
**Luke S:** Um, not officially yet.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Okay.  
**Luke S:** We're waiting for the names to come to  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yeah, me either. So I think that um my character's first uh instinct  
**Luke S:** us.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** would be I just think like my psyllium, our clan, our our world is based on connection, right? So, I feel like my first reaction would be to like reach out and just like grab you and like study myself like as we're standing there, not even using words, but just this like unspoken connection between the two of us that like we can kind of sense each other's like emotions and feelings in that moment just because we are that's like that's my that's like our clan, right? So, I think that's what I would do. like my body like stiffens and I feel overwhelmed and stunned and I like communicate that with you just by like reaching out.  
**Luke S:** I like it. I think my character would be kind of like looking for like kind of a darker like corner or wall or something cuz like things like fungus and spores like they're typically in like the darker area.  
   
 

### 00:37:50

   
**Holly Strebel:** Mhm.  
**Luke S:** So that's like maybe like the safe spot. Nice. like the comfort zone. So, she's kind of looking for that, but like also kind of like grabs back and she like kind of waddles off to to find that safe  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** What do you look like?  
**Luke S:** spot.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** What's here? Are you more turtle or more  
**Luke S:** Uh, shapewise turtle,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** fungus?  
**Luke S:** but like colors and textures and stuff. I think definitely on the mushroom side. And the only thing that I've really decided on my character is I want the turtle shell to be like the red and  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**Luke S:** white spotted mushroom.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I  
**Luke Foreman:** Nice.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** love  
**Luke S:** that you drop into when you get I can turtle and like suck into  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** the paci.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I love it.  
**John Hagey:** Yeah, that's good.  
**Luke S:** Is it soft? Is it like a harder shell? I don't know.  
   
 

### 00:38:43

   
**Luke S:** Yeah, fair enough.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I  
**Luke S:** I'm kind of leaning on the mushroom side, but I haven't fully We'll see.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** think  
**Luke S:** We'll see what your classes are, and it might decide how like constituted and resilient you are.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I think that um if you don't mind I think because we're related I'm going to be a similar I was kind of envisioning similar like more turtle but like very fungi like you said, kind of like texture vibe, but just like internal form, but I'm going to be like a different much more like gray and um sort of dusty, powdery, mushroomy vibe.  
**Luke S:** Nice. Um,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** are the only the only other character detail I need is like do we have huge eyes or do we have little tiny eyes hidden inside the fungus? Medium small. Medium small. Yeah. A little bit more like not quite redeyed. Yeah. Yeah. But not like Yeah.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** I like that.  
**Luke S:** Okay.  
   
 

### 00:39:47

   
**Luke S:** Sweet. Um, so coming out of the forest, it's like Harmony's or at least the the voom vooma is not that far away. Uh, it's, you know, like a quarter day's walk. It was they kind of pllopped it down right on your shore. Um, and you can, as you exit this forest, you're you're close enough to the [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Bloods]] homes that you can see on the horizon, the smoke of their perpetual volcano. Um, so they've kind of split the difference a little bit with where you both are. And um the only people out here are the folks who are who have made arrangements with the mycelum clan to come and like harvest some of the wood in exchange for and it's kind of like working for them because it's um the logging is helping kill the forest and then it's just like growing right back. And um so they they can't seem to get enough of it. And there's a a consistent churn of folks here. And and um maybe as you step outside the forest for the first time, you realize like there's quite a lot of uh industry that's popped up outside the forest just bent on trying to harvest it, trying to beat a path into it.  
   
 

### 00:41:00

   
**Luke S:** But it seems like the only way that they've been able to do it is like capping trees to prevent them from growing, but they're just growing up around it. Like you just can't stop the spread of of of like the fungal nature of this forest. Um so there's not like um a big trail of people walking though because it's just the to and from the forest like um commuter trail, but there is a pretty easy route to follow that y'all could walk along. Um and then eventually that will get you to the city wall and then at at that point or Yeah. And the city does have a wall has a actually quite large wall which you don't really know why. Like the um you might have heard tales of the beasts from the traitors but you haven't really ever seen one. The forest has kept you safe from like anything. The only the worst worst thing that you can remember happening was like um I don't know, you ate too fresh of a fruit one day and it tasted nasty.  
   
 

### 00:41:57

   
**Luke S:** Didn't have any mold in it or something like uh that's the worst history that your clan had. Like the worst experience you've had. Um and yeah, so you're you're able to like the the gates are open though and you're able to walk right in and contest and at that point um you're the sprawl of the academy is the centerpiece of this citadel city, but it it holds 500,000 people. It's big and a lot of it is there's like airports which are mostly like uh most of the beasts seem to be like floating and levitating that they're not they're not using the difference of air pressure to create lift. They're using something else. And there are is a huge port that ships are docking in. there is um uh so that's like and there's always always seems to be people arriving and the city that is still big is you can tell that it's like at capacity. It's it's getting swelled by this huge influx of 100,000 candidates who are coming to Vimua for this once in a-lifetime chance to be part of the next wave of explorers.  
   
 

### 00:43:09

   
**Luke S:** um as Bimu frantically seeks to fill its ranks to prepare for uh like the next the next wave. So um I guess John, Holly, Luke, do you all have an idea of how your character would react to the city? Uh and what they might like want to try to do before reaching the halls because you know like it's very obvious where you need to go once you get to the city. Um,  
**Holly Strebel:** H.  
**Luke S:** and and probably even for all of you, it's obvious know how to get to the city, too. So,  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** it's more how do they react? Um, because no one's going to see you one way or the  
**Holly Strebel:** I think for my character, I've been pondering and I think I'm more going to play  
**Luke S:** other.  
**Holly Strebel:** like a chronically sickly cuz I think that would be easier in some aspect. Um, I also don't think I said, but I think I was going to do [[Trench-Kin|Earthkin]]. Um,  
**John Hagey:** Who  
**Luke S:** Nice.  
**Holly Strebel:** and was going to be like semi like human shaped,  
   
 

### 00:44:11

   
**John Hagey:** are  
**Holly Strebel:** but like limbs are made out of like packed dirt and just like looks like he's constantly crumbling. But he has these giant bug eyes that he has to wear these goggles that he keeps having to syringe fluid into and is constantly like like  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** the sun he's like the the like he starts steaming really easily. So he's constantly like putting on a version of sunscreen that he's just grabbing things at all times. He's just like constantly sick and like affected by being in his new environment. But he's also like incredibly secretive.  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** So there's a lot of like mumbling to himself and like cursing at being at steaming and I gotta get more sunscreen. Like just kind of like that kind of chromoginy,  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** but like you don't know if he's actually insane or what's happening. But he's like not he doesn't develop like he doesn't tell much of what he's thinking. So, I imagine like when he pops out, it's very much of like scrambling to cover himself with  
   
 

### 00:45:16

   
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** whatever he can find, covering his tracks, like he's covering up where he came from. Um, and like his motivation is like he wants to like absorb as much information like so he's like taking the most complicated like route like zigzagging all like he sees where he needs to go but he does not take  
**Luke S:** Got that?  
**Holly Strebel:** a direct route. Like he is like zigzagging all the way to try to just absorb as much information about  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** like his new environment but very much just like like and then like pulling out the syringes,  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** squirting more into his goggles like just Yeah,  
**Luke S:** Yeah. I uh  
**Holly Strebel:** that's what I envision like when he pops up like he knows what to like semi knows what to expect being on the surface. He already knows what he needs to do to like not burn up and also to fill his goggles to pressurize his eyes. But um yeah,  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** he's very like very much covering his tracks as he walks too.  
   
 

### 00:46:33

   
**Holly Strebel:** Like he doesn't want anything being tracked back to where he popped out  
**Luke S:** Okay. Gotcha. So,  
**Holly Strebel:** of.  
**Luke S:** so you're thinking he would he would come out down the shoreline somewhere and then come or he would just, you know, show up in the dock or somewhere where there's it's easy to disguise himself.  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** Okay,  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** cool. Um I I I kind of like this idea that um when he came up, especially if he came up in the dock area where there was a ton of like people and trade and and stuff that maybe there was like um I like this idea of this old man who's just sitting on the side of the  
**Holly Strebel:** Mhm.  
**Luke S:** the wararf and just sees this creature emerge from the water and rather than like doing anything about it, he just has this like really heavy trench coat. He just waddles over and throws it on top of you. And it's very heavy and it like maybe compresses on your shoulders a little bit.  
   
 

### 00:47:22

   
**Holly Strebel:** Perfect. Yeah,  
**Luke S:** And  
**Holly Strebel:** I think he just go he does this like and then as he blinks like just  
**Luke S:** then  
**Holly Strebel:** like like shoots some water out just like this like feeling of just like  
**John Hagey:** Okay.  
**Holly Strebel:** contentment as he's like has weight back on him.  
**Luke S:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** Just like weird dude. here. But um uh he just kind of sits down and then like pulls a bottle and takes a swig from it.  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah, I think he just like goes back.  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Holly Strebel:** Sorry.  
**Luke S:** Uh amazing. And then at that point it's it's it's effortless to follow the crowds and um Okay.  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** So let's do the Ash Bloods then. John, how does how do you arrive  
**John Hagey:** Um, I arrived via the uh the ember trail. So, um I think [[Ignatius]] is a uh Ignatius is an Emberin that uh is kind of in a rebellious teenage stage where while his island and his clan has, you know, has a very like pretty good relationship with Harmony and Trade and stuff, like he he thinks it's wrong.  
   
 

### 00:48:38

   
**John Hagey:** He's like, "We're we're subbing out our own like fuel for this like fake stuff." And like, well, yes, the well, yes, the fire started to get lit a little bit more. He thinks it's like, you know, it's all fake. It's all wrong. It's not how it should be. And uh he he got in trouble with some of the elders of the clan who more or less used this as a uh he got into tr he got into some trouble exploring some areas that he wasn't supposed to be in. And so they kind of just banished him to this trial of adventure because which is kind of what he wanted anyway because he's sure that if he becomes an adventure he's going to go out and find a new source for the  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** heat.  
**Luke S:** Oh,  
**John Hagey:** Um and so he uh he's calling it he he got in trouble and when  
**Luke S:** interesting.  
**John Hagey:** he tried to run away they uh the elders said he was fleeing and he said no this is simply a pilgrimage.  
   
 

### 00:49:26

   
**John Hagey:** And so I think he's arriving into harmony backpack on his shoulder kind of in awe of everything. new kid on the block. Doesn't really know what's going on, but like just knows like I'm going to be an adventure. I'm going to find the new source of heat for the clan and everything's going to go back to the way it should be.  
**Luke S:** Love it. Um, okay. And yeah, I I think that that the ash bloods are not as novel to anyone or you know, like city itself is pretty cosmopolitan. You wouldn't you wouldn't raise any any eyes.  
**John Hagey:** Suspect.  
**Luke S:** Yeah. Or any sort of suspicion. So that leaves us with uh Luke.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah. So, um I think because he's sort of a already there, worked at the university or the academy. I mean, I think he's getting done with a shift working the  
**Luke S:** Mhm.  
**Luke Foreman:** furnace. Is that right? Or boiler that providing the energy.  
**Luke S:** Yeah. Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:50:30

   
**Luke Foreman:** And um is is sort of um like just kind of matter of fact about the about the university as a whole. So it's just like gets done with his shift. Doesn't feel like he needs to necessarily like shower or anything. Just gets his stuff,  
**Luke S:** Mhm.  
**Luke Foreman:** packs up, and heads straight up to the university from down below.  
**Luke S:** Mhm.  
**Luke Foreman:** And uh anyone uh I'm going um it's going to be effectively half [[Trench-Kin|Earthkin]], half human in terms of mechanics, but I think it's more of a distant sort of past.  
**Luke S:** Okay.  
**Luke Foreman:** Um,  
**Luke S:** Very very earthy.  
**Luke Foreman:** like sort of the sort of the Yeah,  
**Luke S:** Everyone's very  
**Holly Strebel:** Mhm.  
**Luke S:** earthy.  
**Luke Foreman:** sort of the like great greatgrandfather was an earth kin or that sort of that  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** sort of idea.  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** And that's for you to work  
**John Hagey:** question.  
**Luke Foreman:** with.  
**John Hagey:** If Holly is made up of like this underwater rock that like is trying to fall apart and everything, what kind of rock are you made out  
   
 

### 00:51:43

   
**Luke Foreman:** I the way I kind of view it is that it's not  
**John Hagey:** of?  
**Luke Foreman:** like it's not like a um what do I want to say? It's it's like he just seems perpetually dirty like like the distance is just like that you don't really know where skin ends and where  
**John Hagey:** Nice.  
**Luke Foreman:** dirt begins. It's kind of like in a conflict.  
**John Hagey:** What's the What's the character from the Peanuts?  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, Lionus got like a buzz grout or uh flies kind of flying  
**John Hagey:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** around. Yeah.  
**Luke S:** Love it.  
**Luke Foreman:** Is in is in just kind of a perpetual state of of dirtiness, of messiness. And um I I think I'm going to go [[Lomi]] is is going to be his name.  
**Luke S:** Low me.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, with an I.  
**John Hagey:** Solid.  
**Luke S:** Okay.  
**Luke Foreman:** And um I think as he's as he's going up to the university, he'll he'll see like uh anyone kind of on the street either like throwing something away uh in like a fantasy trash can or or even like in the the front desk or whatever,  
   
 

### 00:53:01

   
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** the academy, someone the like receptionist shredding a document and putting it in in the fantasy recycling and he'll go up to them and be like, "Hey, you know, there's uh people in this city that take care of that stuff. You know,  
**Luke S:** Amazing.  
**Luke Foreman:** it doesn't just get done." And uh you know, people focus on everything and it just kind of disappears. Not their problem. But uh you know this city would fall apart without people like [[Lomi]]  
**Luke S:** That's that's his whole his whole gig is to just continually remind people that uh they wouldn't you wouldn't be here if you're  
**Luke Foreman:** of public infrastructure.  
**Luke S:** Lomi  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, public infrastructure is important and there are people that that run this  
**Luke S:** Lomi I love it.  
**Luke Foreman:** city.  
**Luke S:** Does um does Lomi have like does he have his people or is he just um like does he have his own family that he's close to in any way?  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah, I think he comes from a uh a long line of boiler workers and um ever since like he can trace it trace it back.  
   
 

### 00:54:15

   
**Luke Foreman:** You're make you sorry that you asked. He'll trace it all the way back to the beginning of of Harmony where his, you know, great great times whatever works worked the boiler built the boiler for the first time. They're his like family home has the the schematics of the boiler hung up in their living room.  
**Luke S:** Nice.  
**Luke Foreman:** That that sort of that sort of idea.  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** and um because he's he's been uh kind of doing an apprenticeship and working as the uh at the academy. His his family sees him as like and and some of like the the other boiler workers see him as like the big uh the big smart guy who works there. Uh, so they're like, "You ought to go do this adventuring thing. They're going to need they're going to need someone to deal with the infrastructure. Uh, someone someone's got to fix the ship if it goes wrong or whatever." So, uh, he applied,  
**Luke S:** Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** I guess, and and got picked uh to uh go be an adventure explorer.  
   
 

### 00:55:35

   
**Luke S:** Yeah. Yeah. So, basically like uh and just to kind of be clear, the application is there there's not really one at this stage. It's you're a candidate. you show up to take the trials and that's your application.  
**Luke Foreman:** Okay. Yeah. Yeah.  
**Luke S:** You just put in like,  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** "Hey, I'm interested. Send me the date." And then they send you the date. So that's why there's 100,000 people showing up,  
**Luke Foreman:** Ah. Okay. Okay.  
**Luke S:** you know, 10,000 person class basically.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Luke S:** Um Okay, awesome. So, uh, the last thing we're gonna do tonight is y'all are going to, um, you're gonna take the trials, which is, um, basically pretty important to your success as a a potential like the what the thing, you know, about the trials. Um whether it was you learned it through asking people on the way in or you learned it by the signs like billeted everywhere all the way across the city saying take this is your chance.  
   
 

### 00:56:41

   
**Luke S:** Come be an explorer.  
**Luke Foreman:** Good  
**Luke S:** The time is now. The world is open. You know like very 1920s somewhere in between like Avatar Kora type um world that's just really excited for this opportunity. Um but you know that the the trials is what ranks your um your likelihood of being a successful candidate. So it it gives you a role an explorer role and that is where what your curriculum is going to be defined by which it basically is going to be your dagger heart class. And it also um puts you through some psychological tests and scores your um scores you on them. And there is a tier ranking of how you perform in these trials, which almost always relates to how successful that person is. The trials are only one of kind of three parts to callulling the 100,000 down to  
**Luke Foreman:** Okay.  
**Luke S:** 10\. There is a second step which is like gened classes. this is just huge auditoriums um you know classic but like tons of people at the same time getting this stuff that's mostly while like the um the curriculum is refined by the  
   
 

### 00:57:51

   
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** intake class. It's almost like a stall phase and then that leads into the they basically put you into an internship day one and you get assigned a crew and your job is to convince a captain to take you  
**Luke Foreman:** You're talking  
**Luke S:** on based off of and so usually the best captains take off the candidates take the candidates with the best initial ranking and then your captain will score you. he will like they they will give a a report card back to the academy. Um so they get free labor and they get an academy stipen for their exploration and you get a grade and that grade will be whether or not you get to continue at the academy. So you have to meet a minimum threshold. So your your performance is evaluated um like individuals can be hurt or helped by the crew that they get assigned. And that is a mostly random process. Spoiler alert, you probably see where this is going for what it means for this group here.  
**Luke Foreman:** Happy.  
   
 

### 00:58:54

   
**Luke S:** Um, so consider that on how your characters might respond to who was probably very likely going to be assigned to their crew uh at the end of this. So, with that in mind, um, I don't know. I I won't have it in the fancy way. So, I'm going to send you this and I'm going to hope that it works. You'll be able to click continue there and you should get like a green I put it in the Google in our text chat. I can put it in the the meet as well. And one second might be unsafe. Yes, I I could be unsafe. That is true.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** It looks cool.  
**Holly Strebel:** Mhm.  
**John Hagey:** execute.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Do you want us to  
**Luke S:** Yeah. Yeah, you can go ahead and start and then screenshot me the last thing that you  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** start?  
**Luke S:** get. and then you'll get to experience your first dice roll here. And just it'll give you a little animation on how that will work.  
   
 

### 01:02:45

   
**Luke Foreman:** Do you want to send just to you or do you just want me to put it in the group as well?  
**Luke S:** I would pref I guess I um it depends how you care how you want to play. Yeah, we should I don't I don't care. I think I probably I want it for me, but I don't know that it really matters.  
**Luke Foreman:** I'll send them to you.  
**John Hagey:** Wait, you're just going to send to him what we  
**Luke Foreman:** Mhm.  
**Luke S:** Yeah, just just screenshot the last thing and text it to  
**John Hagey:** got.  
**Luke S:** me.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** I am candidate  
**Luke S:** 7\.  
**John Hagey:** 82804\.  
**Luke S:** Bye.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Sorry, I was very focused. This is so well done.  
**John Hagey:** This is giving me  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Um, what did you say to do with it?  
**John Hagey:** like  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Just you or the group?  
**Luke S:** Just screenshot it and send it to me.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Okay.  
**John Hagey:** this feels like Enders game style stuff and I love  
   
 

### 01:04:07

   
**Luke S:** Yeah,  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** It's so good.  
**John Hagey:** it.  
**Luke S:** I was determined to make it so that it would be really hard to meta the result.  
**Luke Foreman:** I guess I don't really know what result I'm necessarily going for to be honest.  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah.  
**Luke S:** Yeah. Yeah. Um, so at this point you will have enough to go and create your character.  
**Luke Foreman:** So,  
**Luke S:** Um, oh, I need a little bit.  
**Holly Strebel:** I know I'm sending it to you.  
**Luke S:** I need the bottom.  
**Holly Strebel:** It just wouldn't let me do it in  
**Luke S:** Yeah, fair enough.  
**Holly Strebel:** one.  
**Luke S:** Um,  
**Holly Strebel:** Is that all of it? Yeah.  
**Luke Foreman:** okay.  
**Luke S:** perfect. Yeah, like the I was really bummed I could because the the dice roll I couldn't get the I couldn't get the dice roll to work on the way that I wanted to do it. But on my end on my my version it builds like a tree as you all select stuff so I can  
**Holly Strebel:** Well, that's cool.  
   
 

### 01:05:13

   
**Luke S:** see where you're going which is really satisfying and I can like pause you and reveal things at certain nodes. I was like, I don't know how much I'm going to use this any more in the survey in the campaign, but I like I like trials  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** It's pretty  
**Holly Strebel:** Yeah, that's  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** awesome.  
**Luke S:** part.  
**Holly Strebel:** cool.  
**Luke S:** Thank you. Thank you. I was I I didn't I didn't play test the balance of these um surveys and I'm like really interested with the results so far.  
**John Hagey:** Feel like I just took like a personality  
**Holly Strebel:** I  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** test.  
**Holly Strebel:** know.  
**Luke S:** Yeah, I really was going for like that Enders gamey psych profile  
**John Hagey:** You f\*\*\*\*\*\* nailed that on the  
**Luke S:** vibe.  
**John Hagey:** head.  
**Luke S:** Okay.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** Mhm.  
**Luke S:** Um I think that's just just Sophie. Okay. Got yours. Sweet. Super interesting. Super interesting. Um, okay. So, at this point, you'll have enough to create your character.  
   
 

### 01:06:28

   
**Luke S:** And either you can do that through I can send links, but there's like a dagger heart thing you can go click buttons in. Um, or we're going to move to Foundry, so I probably just end up creating your characters for you based off of what you just output. Um, you will have a chance to choose a subclass soon. So, we're going to do that in as like a half level up in the first like um first session. So, that'll give you a chance to that's the one part of the character I wanted to leave for y'all to control. So, I can send each of you like here are the two options that you might be training towards. Um the other thing that we'll touch on next time is you were um each of you were suggested a captain in the first survey that you took and um that is what your clan thought would be the most like a a person who might help you make waves. So we'll talk about like who that person is next time. But knowing that the gened classes are mostly time for you to build relationships with your other classmates, not really because they might get deleted.  
   
 

### 01:07:38

   
**Luke S:** Um, but more importantly, like finding that internship, finding a crew to take you on is what that time is really for, which requires some exploration of the immediate city and the academy and getting your your legs under you. Um, and some experimenting with your skills and stuff.  
**Holly Strebel:** Cool.  
**Luke S:** So yeah, that is where we will pick up.  
**Sophie Foreman Noone:** exciting.  
**John Hagey:** Nice.  
**Luke S:** Okay.  
**John Hagey:** I'm curious.  
**Luke S:** Um  
**John Hagey:** I want to know what your take is for all the uh You said it's very interesting.  
**Luke Foreman:** Yeah.  
**John Hagey:** Which one was the most surprising? Which one's like without revealing  
**Luke S:** um it is it you you you  
**John Hagey:** anything?  
**Luke Foreman:** Heat.  
**Luke S:** your the crew will have a chance at the chosen one story line. I'll tell you that like there's actually
