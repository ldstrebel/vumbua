This is a great note. You are right; the specific flavor of the "Teal Butlers" and the mechanics of the typewriter add so much texture to the setting.

Here is the **Revised Part 1**, restoring the GM’s descriptive text and the specific interactions with the "Rust" rejection and the Supervisor.

---

### **SCENE 1: THE INTAKE EXAM**

**INT. INTAKE PAVILION \- CUBICLES \- DAY**

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) So, the machine in front of you prints out that first question... all the way up until "Begin Intake." You didn't have to know how to use the typewriter. You just look down and say, "Okay, question number four is four." *Click.* Number three is three. *Click.*

(Beat) It prints out the rank... Gold, Silver, Copper, Rust. It cuts itself off and drops into your hand. A little flag pings up on the corner—*Ping\! Ping\!*—and suddenly an attendant is there to whisk you away. These attendants are running around in these teal butler ties... sort of somewhere between a Sultan and an English butler.

**GM (LUKE S)** (To Sophie) Britt, you would have finished your survey first. If you wanted to try to stall for Aggie to finish her test, you can. Otherwise, y'all are going to get pulled apart in the current.

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** I think I try to stall. Yeah. As I finish, the little flag automatically goes ding. Can I grab the flag and just like... hold it back down?

**GM (LUKE S)** (Describing the consequence) I think that you were able to get it down. But you can see someone... it's like the airport traffic guard. He's way down there on a point and he's walking to you. You can tell that you're going to be the next car that gets the whistle blown at you.

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** Can I try to rip my ticket off and shove it in my pocket and be like... "Something happened\! It didn't print\! Like the Bluetooth's not connected\!"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Attendant) "You finished your exam. Okay, this way, please come."

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** "No, it didn't print. It didn't print. Let me... I'm going to look under the table." (Action) I just get down and start looking underneath. Just shuffling around underneath the desk.

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Attendant) "Excuse me, ma'am. It really is time to go. This cubicle needs to be cleared for the next candidate."

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** "It didn't print\!" (Action) I think I stand up and my shell hits the desk and it knocks over the typewriter. Then I pull it out of my pocket and I say, "Oh, I found it."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Attendant) "Please... please follow me, ma'am."

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** I think I make eye contact with Aggie and I follow.

---

### **SCENE 2: THE WORKING MAN & THE CULL**

**INT. INTAKE PAVILION \- HALLWAY \- CONTINUOUS**

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) As you are working your way through, about one in five is being pulled in a different direction than you. Their flags went up... but the attendants aren't checking receipts until the end. It's like Costco—there’s two guys with a Sharpie checking it off. They are soldier types, wearing thicker jerkens wrapped in an intricate pattern.

**LOMI (LUKE F)** I think just during the general stroll... [[lomi|Lomi]]'s talking with the guy. (In Character) "Hey, there's quite a lot of you here. How's your benefits? You all right? Everybody doing well? They paying you well here?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Attendant) "You are a Copper. It is always good to know your options. I hope you make it through the next round. Do you need a job?"

**LOMI (LUKE F)** "Ah, no. I got a life calling in the boiler room. Family born and raised. Boiler mega-union."

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating the background action) "Come on, sir. Your test is done. Please don't try it again. No, you can't. I'm sorry." (Narrating) You see a different colored attendant, slightly more bulky, come and grab a guy. The guy is just weeping as he gets pulled to the side. The attendant looks back at [[lomi|Lomi]]. (As Attendant) "Oh, sorry about that. Um... you're talking about boiling water?"

**LOMI (LUKE F)** "Yeah, you know, you are doing great work here and you keep doing your thing. I see you're very busy. Just want to make sure you're being taken care of."

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) He ducks as someone throws a hat off the tin. (As Attendant) "Oh gosh, um... thank you for your concern. If you have a God, please pray."

---

### **SCENE 3: IGGY'S CHAOS**

**INT. INTAKE PAVILION \- IGGY'S CUBICLE \- CONTINUOUS**

**IGGY (HOLLY)** I think [[iggy|Iggy]] is gonna ask... (In Character) "Sir... do you have a tissue? I could use a tissue."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Attendant) "No."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "That's okay. That's okay. I have an idea." (Action) He goes up to the receipt thing that's been printing and he just pulls down.

**GM (LUKE S)** Oh, no.

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "I got it. I got it. I have one more question. Where am I?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Attendant) "Oh god. That just dropped our throughput by 100 candidates. This is terrible." (As Supervisor) A taller figure starts working their way through the con. "Oh, um... that's my supervisor. Can you help me fix it? No, it's already gross. Oh, it's so gross." (Narrating) He's picking up slime off of the receipt generator.

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "But I don't know what this is."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Supervisor) "Does [[iggy|Iggy]] use his receipt at all?"

**IGGY (HOLLY)** No, no, he did not use his receipt.

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Supervisor) He waves and grabs Iggy by the arm. "Sir, this way towards the entrance. Welcome to Vumbua."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "Well, thank you so much. I do have questions."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Supervisor) "Good, good. That's what you're here for. Welcome to Curiosity."

---

### **SCENE 4: THE COURTYARD REVEAL**

**EXT. VUMBUA COURTYARD \- DAY**

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) You come through these large marble pillars into this huge courtyard. A monstrous ironclad cruise ship with brass fittings sits in a harbor. Next to it is a smaller version of it that has this airship balloon tied to it. The people are just so small compared to these vessels.

**GM (LUKE S)** (To John) [[ignatius|Ignatius]], you want to roll me something to see how the hell you're processing here? Because I don't think he's seen anything like this.

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** (Rolling) I think that... nine with Fear.

**GM (LUKE S)** Nine with Fear. I think [[ignatius|Ignatius]]... there's kind of a lot going on here.

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** I think Ignatius had this facade of confidence walking in and getting through this, it just melts away. Like, "What the f\*\*\*?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As **[[Valentine Sterling]]**) Coming right after you is a tall, nicely dressed, kind of Bridgerton-esque vibe but a little more meat on him. "Don't worry, friend. It's so... welcome to the show, mate. Oh, wait, are you... from the Ashland Islands? The [[Ember]] Isles?"

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** "What gave it away? Was it the soot or the literal flames?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Valentine) "Um, you are on fire, lad. Yes, it's back, right?" (Beat) "It's hard to wipe off. I mean, it's something that never leaves you. I... all respect. I hope not, actually. I'll see you." (Walking away, then turning) "Oh... will your hand burn me?"

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** "I don't think so." (Action) I shake his hand.

**GM (LUKE S)** It doesn't burn him. (As Valentine) "Alright, jolly good." (Narrating) He storms off, spitting and trying to get the soot off his hand.

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** I think Ignatius finds this really funny because like... that's not a normal thing for him to always be covered in soot. It's just because of how far he's traveled. He plays into it every now and then. We're not barbarians. We clean ourselves.

---

### **SCENE 5: THE UNION MAN**

**EXT. VUMBUA COURTYARD \- CONSTRUCTION ZONE \- CONTINUOUS**

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) Lomi, you might have even seen some of the inside of Vumbua because you came across as part of the maintenance crew. It wouldn't be a huge surprise to you. But I think you're maybe a little bit proud? It is getting pretty close to holding students and it was just a boat and a ship like half a year ago.

**LOMI (LUKE F)** (Previously "Loami or [[britt|Britt]]") I think he he's coming out and just looking around and going... (In Character) "Yeah, this will do. They do good work. You know? What can we say? It's a little more cushy than the Boiler Room. I'll say it. Doesn't take as much grit... but they do good work."

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) Lomi, you recognize someone. There is someone else who surprises you coming out of the exams. All you know him by is **[[Sarge]]**. You know him because the workers would have these campfires set up... the social hour. (As Sarge) He catches your eye. "Loaves? Loaves, we made it. Can you believe it?"

**LOMI (LUKE F)** "Hey, [[Sarge]]\! You made it in\! Hey, I was feeling pretty good about myself until I saw *you* come in, huh? They let anyone in here, huh?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Sarge) "Yeah. Yeah. I'll be honest. Barely cut it. Barely cut it. I didn't... I don't even know what I was talking about. The green flag popped up and I said, 'Alright, let's give this a go.'"

**LOMI (LUKE F)** "You always guess C, right? That's what they say."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Sarge) "Is that the third one? Yeah. I just looked at the typewriter. Seems about right. S\*\*\*, dude. It's kind of a lot going on. I don't know if I'm actually cut out for this."

**LOMI (LUKE F)** "You know, it is pretty overwhelming. I'll be honest. But we'll... we just give it our best shot. See what happens. You know, we always got something to go back to if it doesn't work out."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Sarge) "Yeah, you're right. I gotta remember why I'm here. Doing this for the lads."

---

### **SCENE 6: THE DEAN'S WELCOME**

**INT. THE GREAT HALL \- DAY**

The candidates are herded into a massive auditorium.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) The flow takes all of you across into this massive auditorium. It sits 10,000. It's mostly all from Harmony... you all are a quite a bit of a minority. Every time someone recognizes you're from a different place, it's like a minor celebrity status.

(Beat) After a few minutes, a small figure—if you've seen *Arcane*, think Professor Heimerdinger but a female version—bounces onto the stage. This is **[[dean-isolde-vane|Dean Isolde Vane]]**.

**GM (LUKE S)** (As [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Isolde]]) "Hello students\! Hello candidates\! Hello potential adventurers\! I'm just so excited for this next class. It's going to be amazing. We, all of us, are the inheritors of great discovery\!" (Pacing frantically) "For 80 years... 80 years our maps have been static\! We've missed the thrill of adventure. No one's wanted to do it. I've been lonely, honestly. Not to say my thousand weren't great, but more is better\!"

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** (Previously "Loami or [[britt|Britt]]") I think during this part of the speech, I whisper to [[aggie|Aggie]]. (In Character) "I don't trust this f\*\*\*ing guy."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As [[Dean Isolde Vane|Dean Isolde]]) "We've got [[ash-bloods|Ash Bloods]] whose mastery of heat brings new fire to our Core\! We've got the [[mizizi|Mizizi]]... who, well, we don't really know what they do, and that's amazing\! We don't know\! It's been so long since we could say that about anything\!"

(Beat) "But... unfortunately, we do have to lose another 20,000 of you by the end of the week. So, study hard. Listen to your professors. Welcome to Vumbua\!"

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) She pops back out from the curtain. "Oh\! I'm Dean. I'm Dean Isolde\! If you need me... well, I'm kind of busy." (Narrating) Then, an attendant comes out. For the [[mizizi|Mizizi]], you recognize **[[Rill]]** ([[Rill|The River-Born]]). She leans out, pulls the Dean back behind the curtain. She seems to have a very familiar relationship with the Dean. She waves good luck to you and goes in.

---

### **SCENE 7: THE TISSUE INCIDENT**

**INT. GREAT HALL EXIT \- CONTINUOUS**

The group is being herded out. Iggy (The [[Trench-Kin|Earthkin]]) is dripping wet and sneezing.

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "Hey... did you guys feel that? Is that... wind? What is that?"

**LOMI (LUKE F)** "Yeah. The door opened. We're getting directed out. Iggy. Ignatius. All right. I can remember that."

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) There is a little kid walking around to people. He's holding a little ball of fire. (As [[Lucky]]) "Hey you\! I'm **Lucky**. You need something? You let Lucky know. That guy's red hot hair? Look at it. Got it right here. Authentic. Probably an [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Blood]]. Two gold pieces. Hot off the rock." (To Iggy) "You? I'm Lucky. I'm as tall as you are. Do you need more height? I can get it for you."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "No, I like my height. But I could use a Kleenex."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As [[Lucky]]) "Oh, I knew it. I got just the thing for you." (Rummaging) He pulls out like... the turban that the guards were wearing. "I found this one just outside. I think it'll be nice. I'll give it to you for one gold."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "I got no money."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Lucky) "Hm. That's okay. You can be lucky today. I'll just give you the whole thing. But you... you're gonna be unlucky if you don't come back and find Lucky. And if you find something cool, I'm your guy."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "Thank you. Well, I *do* have something cool." (Action) He has his satchel of gizmos. "Are you interested in an invention?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Lucky) "Heck yeah. What do they do?"

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "This one makes noise... and that's it." (Action) He pulls out a very extravagant version of a trumpet-trombone instrument that unfolds like an accordion. It makes the most god-awful sound.

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Lucky) "Well... I'm pretty lucky, but I don't even know if I'm lucky enough to do something with that. I'll tell you what, I'll take it anyway. Hey, make sure that when that guy comes in here... he probably don't want to see you with that." (Narrating) Lucky bolts. A Guard comes in—absent his turban. Iggy is standing on a chair with the thing.

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Guard) "Hey, hey, hey\! You took my turban\!"

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "No, this is a Kleenex."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Guard) "No, that was... that goes... uh... I'm going to have to take it from you."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "I mean... I kind of need it, but here you go. Have a nice day." (Action) He hands back the snot-filled turban and just walks away.

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** Ignatius is just laughing his ass off. He grabs Lomi. "Let's go."

**LOMI (LUKE F)** "Yeah, let's get out of here. I'm definitely not feeling quite as lucky as that guy. Let's get lost."

---

Here is **Part 3** of the transcript, covering the **Dorm Assignments**, **Iggy’s Climbing Expedition**, and the introduction of **Sarah Fox**.

I have continued to attribute "Loami or Britt" based on context:

* **Britt (Sophie):** Interacting with the crane, telling Iggy to come down, being suspicious/aggressive toward Sarah.  
* **Lomi (Luke F):** Heading to Block 99, critiquing the bonfire construction.

---

### **SCENE 8: THE PUNCH CARDS**

**EXT. ACADEMY COURTYARD \- DAY**

The group exits the Great Hall. A machine prints out punch cards for housing assignments.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) You make your way towards the end of the aisle corridor. You pass by the machine, and it prints out a punch card for each of you. It drops into your hand.

(Reading Results) Iggy... Block 12\. Ignatius... Block 12\. Lomi... Block 99\. Britt and [[aggie|Aggie]]... Block 04\.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) The campus loops around in a big horseshoe. On the far side, there is a map. And there is a student with a bullhorn. (As Bullhorn Student) "Go to your rooms for tonight\! Tomorrow, your first class: Gen-Ed Exploration, 8:00 AM\! Sleep tight\! Tomorrow, first class\!"

**GM (LUKE S)** (To Sophie & Kristina) Britt and Aggie, I feel like y'all got out of the main room pretty quick. Do you go straight to the dorms to settle in, or do you go explore?

**AGGIE (VIA LUKE S)** I think now that people are spreading out, Aggie is a little less overwhelmed. Curiosity is growing. She wants to see more. At least do a lap around the buildings before going back.

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** (Previously "Loami or Britt") I think my instinct is definitely not to go to the dorm. I think I'm like... "We need to look around."

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) Okay. You see Greek Row... a posh club feel. You see the Clan Assistance Office. You see the huge library. Block 04, your dorm, is a modular unit built into a terraced cliff. It looks like a repurposed green room. Block 99 is a geothermal plant with steam coming out of it. And Block 12 is the classic dorms.

---

### **SCENE 9: THE DETOUR**

**EXT. ACADEMY HALLWAYS / COURTYARD \- CONTINUOUS**

**GM (LUKE S)** Ignatius and Lomi, would y'all have gone directly to your assigned rooms?

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** As soon as Ignatius finds out that Iggy—this little guy I had a short conversation with—is my roommate... he’s like, "Oh, I guess we're going to be bunkmates. Should we go to our room?" (In Character) "I guess we're going to go to our room now, right?"

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "I'm not going to the room."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** "Oh. Where... where are you going?"

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "I don't know. There's so much to see."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** "Yeah, but we have class tomorrow."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "Look. Class. I need to find out things. I'm just gonna walk around. You don't have to come."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** Ignatius is appalled. He was about to be a rule follower, and this little thing was like, "No." (Internal Monologue) *Who am I? All right.* (Action) Ignatius is just gonna follow the whims of Iggy for a little bit. He is less curious about the surroundings and more curious about... what is this little thing gonna do?

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) Iggy, where do your feet take you?

**IGGY (HOLLY)** He has his journal back out. He pulls some contraption out of his bag—a big magnifying glass that amplifies his already ginormous eyes. He is walking down every hallway, looking at everything, drawing the whole thing. It looks like a schizophrenic is taking notes. (In Character) "Oh, this is good. This is good. Oh... this is nothing." (Action) He hands Ignatius random things to hold while he inspects small details.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) You exit into the courtyard. There are cranes in the air dropping large loads of materials.

**IGGY (HOLLY)** I think he’s outside... and if there’s a crane, he’s trying to climb it. He wants the top vantage point to assess his surroundings.

---

### **SCENE 10: THE CRANE CLIMB**

**EXT. INDUSTRIAL ZONE \- CONTINUOUS**

**GM (LUKE S)** Britt and Aggie, you start making your way towards the industrial side. You see a man on fire looking up at a little creature who is halfway up a crane... just hanging by his feet.

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** (Previously "Loami or Britt") I think it's definitely a looking up and being like... "Huh. What's going on?" And then I think I say to Aggie... (In Character) "That looks promising. Come on." (Action) I head toward Iggy and Ignatius.

**GM (LUKE S)** (To Holly) Iggy, you get pretty high up. You've been above ground before, but never with *sky*. Are you looking up or down?

**IGGY (HOLLY)** I think... at some point, you can touch it, right? Like, I'm going to be able to touch the sky?

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** (Calling up) "I think you *are* touching it."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "No, but like... I don't feel it."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** "I didn't know you *could* feel it."

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** (Walking up) "Who is that? Come down. Come down\!"

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "Why? Why are you guys following me? Nobody ever follows me. I just need to see something."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** "I'm pretty sure you're my roommate."

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** I think Britt reaches out and starts to shake the scaffolding. (In Character) "Come down now."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "Hey, hey, hey\! What are you doing? Hold on. Hold on." (Action) In my mind, Iggy is trying to plot out the whole campus on a sheet. He wants a map. And he thinks he's going to be able to grab a cloud.

---

### **SCENE 11: ENTER SARAH FOX**

**EXT. INDUSTRIAL ZONE \- CONTINUOUS**

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) As you are gathered around this crane, you see coming toward you a small woman. She is carrying a little notebook, all prim and proper. Very student-looking. (As Sarah Fox) "Hi. Um, what are y'all doing? Do you know each other? Oh my god. Are you... are you from the Island? And are you [[Ash-Bloods|Ash Blood]]? Three of you all in one group? Oh, what a splendorous occasion\!"

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** (Previously "Loami or Britt") "Take a photo. It'll last longer."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** Ignatius is just looking down like... "Huh? Is she talking to us?"

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** "Can we... can we help you? What do you need?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Sarah) "Uh, well, I was going to invite you over to the Bonfire tonight. We're digging a hole and we're..."

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "What's a bonfire?" (Action) He puts the notebook away and slides down the outside of the scaffolding.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) We see him disappear in a plume of dust, and then he’s just standing there. Impressive.

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Sarah) "Oh my. Um... well, I just wanted to say hi and invite you." (She looks nervous of Britt) "I'm... I'm an ally. Is that okay to say?"

**AGGIE (VIA LUKE S)** "Don't mind my cousin. Hi, I'm Aggie."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Sarah) "Hi. My name's Sarah. Sarah Fox." (She shakes Aggie's hand) "How are y'all settling in?"

**IGGY (HOLLY)** "I don't know. We just found these guys."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** Ignatius is gonna lean over to Britt and go... (Whispering) "I don't trust this b\*\*\*\*."

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Sarah) "I haven't seen anybody else who's not from Harmony except... well..." (She looks past them) "Are you also on fire? I can't tell."

---

### **SCENE 12: THE UNION MAN ARRIVES**

**EXT. BLOCK 99 / BONFIRE PIT \- CONTINUOUS**

**GM (LUKE S)** Lomi is over there too. Lomi, you were going to the dorm?

**LOMI (LUKE F)** (Previously "Loami or Britt") He's going 99\. I'd say Lomi unintentionally gets to 99\. He sees the steam stacks and is like, "All right, here we go." And then he sees it's Building 99\.

**GM (LUKE S)** (Narrating) He sees Iggy drop out of the crane like a wrecking ball. He sees the Mizizi girls.

**LOMI (LUKE F)** He's seeing a crowd. He'll saddle up. (Action) He walks up to the bonfire pit where other candidates are throwing stuff in. (In Character) "So, you thinking you're going to use like an accelerant or something? Or we just going to go... what do we got? Straight lumber in there? What's the plan?"

**GM (LUKE S)** (As Student) "Oh, this is not the problem. We have it all masked out. Optimal flow. We get the light winds at the bottom... but, well, we don't have a source of flame yet. That is a problem."

**IGNATIUS (JOHN)** Ignatius is just going to sit there and not say a f\*\*\*ing thing.

**LOMI (LUKE F)** I think that's when Lomi looks over his shoulder. (In Character) "I think we can solve that." (Action) He starts walking over to Ignatius.

---

Here is the final section of the script, covering the **Table Debrief** where the players established their primary motivations and what they want to get out of the campaign.

I have stripped out the scheduling logistics to focus purely on the narrative hooks they selected.

---

Here is the corrected script for the final segment of **Session 0** based on the **vumbua 1** transcript.

I have parsed the "Loami or Britt" speaker tags based on the content of the speech (Sophie speaking for Britt, Luke F speaking for Lomi).

### **SCENE 13: THE CAMPAIGN HOOKS (DEBRIEF)**

**INT. VIRTUAL TABLETOP \- NIGHT**

**GM (LUKE S)** (To the Group) The couple of things that I'd be interested to hear... what are the parts that are intriguing you the most? (Counting off options) It could be **Exploration**—the world is ready to be discovered. It could be **Politics**—figuring out what's going on at the Academy. It could be just doing really good in **Class** \[`1204-1205`\].

**BRITT (SOPHIE)** (Previously "Loami or Britt") I definitely think Britt's motivation is... I think **unintentionally she's very, very good in class**. But her main interest has always lied in: What are the **political ramifications** of the Academy? (Beat) And what is hiding below the surface? Because **something is**. \[`1205`\]

**GM (LUKE S)** Cool. Anybody else know or you still thinking about it? \[`1205`\]

**LOMI (LUKE F)** (Previously "Loami or Britt") I think for Lomi, it would be the **Transition**. From candidate to student, and then forming the party. How does that work? How do you get selected? (Beat) And then... what are the first steps out of the Academy? He is interested in this **newfound vigor for exploration**. \[`1205-1206`\]

**GM (LUKE S)** Cool. And Iggy?

**IGGY (HOLLY)** I think Iggy would be fine with whatever ends up giving him **Answers**. (Beat) Exploration sounds fun. But I don't know if the deep under-workings of what is going on are tied to the Academy, or if it's something you find out *outside* of the Academy. That would influence my answer. \[`1206`\]

---

### **Session 1 Prep: The Player Hooks**

Based on this specific conversation, here are the narrative levers you need to pull for Session 1:

1. **Britt (The Unintentional Ace):** Sophie explicitly stated Britt is "unintentionally very, very good in class" \[`1205`\].

   * *Session 1 Goal:* Give her a moment in the "Gen-Ed" scene where she answers a question correctly without trying, annoying the "Gold" NPCs (like Valerius or [[Calculus Prime]]) who actually studied. This frees her up to snoop on the **Politics**.  
2. **Lomi (The Process Guy):** Luke F is interested in the *mechanics* of the transition—"How do you get selected?" \[`1205`\].

   * *Session 1 Goal:* Make the "Squad Assignment" and the "Captain Interviews" feel bureaucratic and weighty. He wants to see the gears of the institution turning.  
3. **Iggy (The Data Hunter):** Holly is undecided on *where* the answers are (Inside vs. Outside) \[`1206`\].

   * *Session 1 Goal:* Present two distinct mysteries. One internal (Why is the power flickering?) and one external (What are those weird ships?). See which one Iggy chases.
