# Session 3: The Celestial Lounge and The Ambush

## Session Summary
The party arrives at the Celestial Lounge in the Upper Core. Iggy gains a new cartography experience mapping the city's view. Lomi joins Val and Ember in a game of "Crown and Ruin," winning while Iggy tries a Grease Shot. Val reveals information about an upcoming exam on the first day of class and admits to selling a "study guide" for it to Lucky. Later, as the players leave the lounge, Britt notices a suspicious group communicating in sign language. She approaches them for directions, but their leader, Azor, instead leads her into an alley and ambushes her with two large accomplices, Zyykl and Tus. She loses her test-related receipt but manages to fight back and retain her cherished family heirloom—a petrified acorn necklace. Zyykl and Tus flee with the receipt. Iggy, Lomi, and Aggie arrive as Britt pins Azor. During interrogation, they learn Azor failed his own entrance exam and recruited the others from Septal to steal a receipt. Britt takes Azor's pocket watch as compensation. Enraged by Azor's lack of remorse, Lomi punches the downed man, breaking a rib. The group decides to find Lucky tomorrow, using Azor's pocket watch and the embellished story of Lomi "heroically" breaking ribs as leverage to get the study guide.

## Play-by-Play

### Arrival at the Celestial Lounge
* The party ([[lomi|Lomi]], [[britt|Britt]], and [[iggy|Iggy]]) arrive at the [[celestial-lounge|Celestial Lounge]].
* They are immediately drawn to the impressive, sweeping view of Vumbua.
* [[iggy|Iggy]] spends time observing the layout, leading the GM to grant him a "cartography" experience trait.
* [[britt|Britt]] and [[lomi|Lomi]] begin looking around for games to play in the lounge.

### A Game of Crown and Ruin
* They spot [[valerius-sterling|Val]] and [[ember|Ember]] playing a game called "Crown and Ruin".
* [[lomi|Lomi]] decides to join them for a game while [[iggy|Iggy]] orders a "Grease Shot" to drink.
* The game involves rolling Hope and Fear dice against a target of 13.
* [[lomi|Lomi]] rolls a 15, successfully beating [[valerius-sterling|Val]].
* [[britt|Britt]] takes a moment to compose herself, using a Hope point to clear a point of Stress.

### The Study Guide Revelation
* After the game, [[lomi|Lomi]] queries [[valerius-sterling|Val]] regarding the exams scheduled for the first day of class.
* [[valerius-sterling|Val]], likely under the influence of the drinks, admits that he wrote a challenging test and sold it as a "study guide" to [[lucky|Lucky]].
* [[valerius-sterling|Val]] explains his motive: *"I didn't really write the study guide... I just wrote a really hard test so that if people are scared about it, they'll buy this test... I wanted to ensure that if people could get the answers on my test, they would have really good fundamentals."*
* Shortly after this admission, [[valerius-sterling|Val]] passes out from a combination of drinking and exhaustion. [[ember|Ember]], having lost the game, returns to taking notes.

### The Alley Ambush
* As attendants begin to clean up the floor around the passed-out [[valerius-sterling|Val]], the party decides they need to track down [[lucky|Lucky]].
* [[britt|Britt]] notices a suspicious group—[[azor|Azor]] and two large bruisers, [[zyykl|Zyykl]] and [[tus|Tus]]—communicating openly via sign language as they leave.
* Feeling curious, [[britt|Britt]] approaches them for directions to Block 99. [[azor|Azor]] claims he failed his candidacy run but knows the city, offering to show her the way.
* [[iggy|Iggy]] attempts to tail them, but [[azor|Azor]] starts playing a game of evasion, turning the navigation into an intense *"lose the tail spy game,"* leading [[britt|Britt]] into an unfamiliar alleyway before springing an ambush.
* [[britt|Britt]] takes a heavy blow to the back of the head, opting to spend all four of her armor slots to reduce it from severe to major damage (taking 2 damage and 2 Stress).
* She is grappled in a net, uses her phone network feature to ping [[aggie|Aggie]] with directions (taking 1 Stress), and breaks free.
* During the scuffle, [[zyykl|Zyykl]] and [[tus|Tus]] take her test receipt. [[azor|Azor]] sneers, *"You have nothing of value, did you? This is not even worth my time,"* before attempting to snatch her family heirloom—a petrified acorn necklace—and making off with it. 
* [[zyykl|Zyykl]] and [[tus|Tus]] flee in a different direction. [[britt|Britt]] chases down [[azor|Azor]]; moving quickly despite the strange, slow appearance of her turtle-like movements, she tackles and pins him to the ground in a rage to reclaim her necklace.
* [[iggy|Iggy]] arrives immediately after from a shortcut, seeing [[britt|Britt]] handling the situation. Shortly after, [[aggie|Aggie]], [[lomi|Lomi]], and [[ignatius|Ignatius]] arrive.
* During the interrogation, [[azor|Azor]] reveals he recruited the others from Septal. He rationalizes his actions, taunting the group: *"You may paint me as the villain, but I'm not the one out here squandering my chance on the week before the biggest week of your lives. Drinking at 2 AM..."* 
* He also claims the receipt is worthless anyway since the Loom knows who a person is. 
* Finding his rationalizations irresponsible, [[britt|Britt]] rips his pocket watch from his coat as compensation. 
* Disgusted by Azor's attitude, [[lomi|Lomi]] punches the subdued man in the gut with an massive 18 roll, breaking his rib and rendering him helpless against the wall.

### Regrouping and Planning
* The party regroups outside the alley after the confrontation.
* They solidify their plan for the next day. As [[lomi|Lomi]] puts it: *"Tomorrow we find Lucky. We barter for the study guide. And we ace the exam."*
* They decide their best leverage is to use the stolen pocket watch and the embellished "heroic" story of [[lomi|Lomi]] breaking the ribs of Britt's attacker as bartering tools.
* The session ends with a long rest mechanic where players clear their HP, Stress, and Armor slots.
