## Quick Summary

The party gathers at the [[Block 99]] Bonfire. Amidst the celebration, they encounter [[Percy Vane-Smythe III]] spinning theories about missing elemental clans. [[lomi|Lomi]] secures a case of "grease" (moonshine) from a dealer named [[Lucky]]. As the group bonds over their disparate cultures—specifically the [[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Bloods]]' relationship with heat and the [[mizizi|Mizizi]]' pragmatic view of death—a mysterious girl named [[Zephyr]] drinks the moonshine and inadvertently summons a bolt of purple lightning. [[Rill]], the Mizizi exchange student, appears to whisk Zephyr away, leaving the party with questions. They decide to cap the night by investigating the upscale [[Celestial Lounge]].

## Scenes

### Scene 1: The Bonfire Theories

**Location:** [[Block 99]] Bonfire  
**NPCs Present:** [[Percy Vane-Smythe III]], [[Bramble]], [[Sarge]] (background), [[Zephyr]]  
**Time:** Evening

*GM Narration:*

As the party settles in, they overhear a heated argument. A well-dressed man, [[Percy Vane-Smythe III]], is loudly proclaiming his theories to a skeptical crowd, including a veteran named [[Sarge]] and a plant-like person named [[Bramble]].

**[[Percy Vane-Smythe III]]:** "Listen, listen. I'll wager 50 sovereigns that there's an Earth clan underground theory. The theories say that there must be one. We've got two—Ash Blood and [[mizizi|Mizizi]]. There's got to be more. The symmetry! We have plants, fire... there's going to be water, earth, air..."

**[[Bramble]]:** "What if they are not the missing? What if *we* are the ones who forgot?"

**[[Zephyr]]:** "Or maybe the world is just broken. Not everything needs to be a pattern."

**[[lomi|Lomi]]:** *[To Iggy]* "I think as soon as I hear the topic of this, he loses all interest. Like immediately he's just like, 'All right, whatever.'"

**[[ignatius|Ignatius]]:** "They're talking about like a sub-race of Earthkin that live subterraneously, right? Like a hollow earth theory sort of deal."

Iggy debates whether to reveal anything about his people but decides to play it cool. Lomi steps in, leveraging his boiler room cover.

**[[lomi|Lomi]]:** "I don't mean to butt in... being as I am doing some work in the boiler room, I think we've got some theories. You know, we hear some things... noises that happen when we're down there. I like to believe there is a people out there living down there watching us. A very friendly people."

**[[Percy Vane-Smythe III]]:** "Count on the working man to know the truth! Percy Vane-Smythe III." *[Extends hand]*

**[[lomi|Lomi]]:** "Lomi Sultano. Boiler Maker family for ages."

**[[Zephyr]]:** *[Sprints over]* "Either way, what a crap place to live. That would suck. Buried underground, not under the sky... What do you even do for fun?"

**[[lomi|Lomi]]:** "What do I do for fun? Hey, I heard there's some engine oil going around here somewhere."

**[[Zephyr]]:** "Oh, things to drink. I love drinking things. Let's do it."

**Player Discoveries:**
- [[Percy Vane-Smythe III]] believes there are missing elemental clans (Air, Earth, Water) based on symmetry.
- [[lomi|Lomi]] successfully bluffs/hints about "friendly people underground" without exposing Iggy's true nature.
- [[Zephyr]] is impulsive, loves storms/sky, and hates the idea of being underground.

**GM Notes:**
> [!NOTE]
> Percy acts as a lore dump vehicle for the "Missing Clans" theory, which is a key metanarrative hook. Lomi's improvisation about the "noises in the boiler room" was a great character beat that aligned perfectly with Iggy's need for secrecy while still acknowledging the truth.

### Scene 2: Getting Lucky

**Location:** The Bonfire (Lucky's Stash)  
**NPCs Present:** [[Lucky]], [[Sarge]]  
**Time:** Evening

*GM Narration:*

Percy leads Lomi toward a shady figure named Lucky.

**[[Percy Vane-Smythe III]]:** "Easy luck. I'm here for some of that grease."

**[[Lucky]]:** "Oo, I got grease. I can grease your gears. I can grease your livers. Which one do you want Lucky to grease?"

They negotiate a price (one sovereign/case) for six tall jars of moonshine. As Lomi takes the goods, he checks with [[Sarge]], watching from the shadows.

**[[lomi|Lomi]]:** *[Gestures to the jars]* "Is this stuff any good?"

**[[Sarge]]:** *[Nods resignedly, kicking two empty bottles at his feet]*

**Player Discoveries:**
- [[Lucky]] is the local contraband dealer.
- "Grease" is potent moonshine.
- [[Sarge]] seems to be a regular patron (or victim) of Lucky's wares.

### Scene 3: Cultural Exchange & The Nature of Death

**Location:** The Bonfire (Main Group)  
**NPCs Present:** [[Serra Vox]]  
**Time:** Evening

*GM Narration:*

Back at the fire, Serra tries to smooth over her earlier awkwardness. The conversation turns deep as the characters discuss their homes.

**[[Serra Vox]]:** "I'm really nervous about tomorrow... I don't know anything sometimes. Every other place that's ever been discovered has a purpose... It's very strange that we don't exactly know what the forest is for other than apparently surviving and living... No, not just living, also dying. It's all about balance."

**[[britt|Britt]]:** "Death is the way of things. Without death, there can be nothing new."

**[[aggie|Aggie]]:** "Wow... It's the one inevitable truth. I don't want to die. Do you?"

**[[britt|Britt]]:** "Everything dies. Maybe that's a fact. But maybe everything that dies someday comes back."

The topic shifts to the Ash Bloods and their integration. Iggy pulls out a hot stone from his pocket.

**[[ignatius|Ignatius]]:** "The rocks here, they really only provide heat energy. Not quite the same as the crystals from the Seed of Harmony. We know that with Harmony's discovery of our islands like the heat picked back up."

**[[britt|Britt]]:** "What did your clan gain from working with Harmony?"

**[[ignatius|Ignatius]]:** "Trade. And... [[Lady Ignis]]. She went with [[Captain Elara Thorne|Captain Elara Thorne]] back to the [[Seed of Harmony]]. Now her line holds the highest voting power in all of Harmony."

**[[aggie|Aggie]]:** "It's become our historical pattern that a new civilization should be given the most power... giving the least of us the power of the most of us."

**Player Discoveries:**
- **Mizizi Philosophy:** Death is viewed pragmatically/spiritually as essential for new life ("reincarnation" is hinted at).
- **Ash Blood History:** The "Great Cooling" was reversed when Harmony arrived. [[Lady Ignis]] is a major historical figure.
- **Harmony Politics:** New member civilizations are traditionally given the highest voting power (the "Seat of Harmony") to ensure fair representation/integration.

### Scene 4: The Lightning

**Location:** The Bonfire  
**NPCs Present:** [[Zephyr]], [[Rill]], [[Bramble]], [[Sarge]]  
**Time:** Late Evening

*GM Narration:*

Lomi returns with the "grease." Zephyr is eager to try it.

**[[Zephyr]]:** "That smells like... you try first."

Lomi takes a sip, confirms it's strong, and spits a mist over the fire for effect. Zephyr follows suit but takes a massive gulp.

**GM:** She starts turning purple. Static electricity builds, her hair stands on end. Two things happen at once: She spits a mouthful of shine into the fire (*WHOOSH*), and a massive purple lightning bolt crackles down from the sky, striking around her.

**[[Zephyr]]:** *[Oblivious]* "That one was pretty good."

**[[Bramble]]:** "Holy f*** girl."

**[[Sarge]]:** "That was *electrifying*."

Suddenly, [[Rill]] (from the Mizizi exchange) appears and grabs Zephyr.

**[[Rill]]:** "There you are! We've been looking all over for you. Come on!"

**[[Zephyr]]:** "No, I don't want to go! It's so boring!"

**[[Rill]]:** "I got us hot chocolate. Come on back. *[To the group]* Come find me tomorrow after class!"

**[[ignatius|Ignatius]]:** "Wait, what's Lightning Girl's name?"

**[[Rill]]:** "Note to self: take *Zephyr*—not Lightning Girl, you Lava Boy—back to the building."

**Player Discoveries:**
- [[Zephyr]] has uncontrollable/wild lightning abilities triggered by the moonshine.
- [[Rill]] is Zephyr's handler/friend and knows [[aggie|Aggie]]/[[britt|Britt]] from her exchange year.
- "Lava Boy" and "Lightning Girl" nicknames established.

**GM Notes:**
> [!NOTE]
> Zephyr's display of power was clearly magical/elemental, not tech. Everyone (Sarge, Lomi, Iggy) recognized it as abnormal. Rill's quick intervention suggests she's keeping Zephyr on a short leash.

### Scene 5: The Boiler Room & The Plan

**Location:** The Bonfire  
**NPCs Present:** None (Party focus)  
**Time:** Late Night

*GM Narration:*

Lomi introduces himself properly to Britt and Aggie, explaining his boiler room background.

**[[lomi|Lomi]]:** "We use the [[Leidian]] from the [[ash-blood-isles|Ash-Blood Isles]]. Best stuff."

**[[ignatius|Ignatius]]:** "Obsidian. I have now named it [[Leidian]]. Just take lava and obsidian and smash those two babies together."

Iggy reveals his character motivation:

**[[ignatius|Ignatius]]:** "I want to find the heart of the volcano. The next [[Leidian]] deposit. I want to find out *why* it's reheating."

The group decides to keep the night going.

**[[lomi|Lomi]]:** "I heard some people talking about the Celestial Lounge. I'd be interested in checking it out."

**[[britt|Britt]]:** "I think we got one more party in us."

**GM:** The group heads out, passing the Golden Welcome and headed towards the tall building with the sign: **[[Celestial Lounge|The Celestial Lounge]]**.

## GM Reflections

### What Worked Well
- The contrast between the high-society setting and Lomi's "boiler room" energy.
- The "Campfire chat" naturally exposing deep lore differences (Death/Heat).
- Zephyr's introduction was explosive (literally) and memorable.

### Adjustments for Next Time
- Ensure the transition to the Celestial Lounge allows for distinct social encounters.
- Follow up on the "Missing Clans" theory—Percy is a goof, but he's right.
