### [[Session 02Pt5|Session 2.5: The Power Room]]
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Type:** 1-on-1 side session ([[Iggy]] / Holly)

While the party socializes at the bonfire, Iggy slips away to explore the Academy's power plant. He discovers the resonator battery infrastructure and meets **[[Professor Kante]]**, a tortoise professor of harmonics who draws him into a conversation about the [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] decline and the Ash-Blood Anomaly.

**Key Events:**
- Iggy Irish-goodbyes from the bonfire to investigate the power plant
- Meets [[Tommy]] (gnome clerk) and [[Lucina]] (dwarf mechanic) in the lobby
- Discovers over-engineered Panda 5 resonator batteries and charts showing the [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] decline
- [[Professor Kante]] appears and explains the Minimum Crisis and the missing Ash-Blood surge
- Kante gives Iggy an umber crystal and invites him to return as a collaborator
- Iggy rejoins the group for the Celestial Lounge trip

**Players Discovered:**
- The Global Amplitude measures Harmony's total ether power — it increases with each node integration
- The amplitude has been declining for 30-40 years — unprecedented in recorded history
- The Ash-Blood integration produced only ~20 amps instead of expected +300 to +800
- Panda 5 batteries are surge regulators/receptors, not storage — powered by umber crystals
- The Night of Sparks (~400 years ago) burned the world for two months due to unregulated surge
- The Apex 1 next-gen battery line was scrapped because the expected surge never came
- Professor Kante's theory: integration works through cultural connection, not resource extraction
- The [[Trench-Kin]] are known to Harmony as border defenders ("trail tales from the Trench")

She loses test-related documents but retrieves her cherished pocket watch. Lomi and Iggy intervene, forcing the ambushers to flee. The group decides to find Lucky to get the study guide.
