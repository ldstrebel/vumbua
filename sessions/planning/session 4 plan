## Phase 3: The Morning After

### Scene: Post-Ambush → Bed

After the ambush, the party stumbles back to the dorms. They're battered, confused, maybe carrying an unconscious Nstyl fighter. The campus is dead quiet.

**GM Pressure Points:**
- It is **extremely late**. Exams start in a few hours.
- Anyone who tries to investigate Azer tonight instead of sleeping should be warned: *"You can chase this now, or you can sleep. But the exam doesn't care about your night."*
- If they report the ambush to campus security, the response is slow and bureaucratic — forms to fill, statements to give. Time bleeds away.

**Transition:** Handwave the rest of the night. *"You collapse into your bunks. Your head barely hits the pillow before—"*

---

### Scene: Morning — The Wake-Up Call

> **BULLHORN:** *"ATTENTION ALL FIRST-YEAR CANDIDATES. REPORT TO THE MAIN COURTYARD AT 0800 HOURS FOR TRACK ASSIGNMENT. THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. STRAGGLERS WILL BE MARKED."*

**Mood:** Harsh morning light. Sore muscles. Not enough sleep. The glamour of the Celestial Lounge feels like a different lifetime. The bruises from the ambush are real.

**Quick Beats:**
- PCs wake up, possibly with Stress still marked from the ambush or sleep deprivation
- Breakfast is "Nutri-Paste" (bland, efficient) unless they make it to Captain's Table (real food, for high ranks)
- Other students are buzzing about the exams — nobody knows about the ambush
- Any NPC who spots their bruises will ask questions

---

### Scene: Track Assignment

This is the in-fiction moment where the PCs choose their **Daggerheart class/subclass**, framed as the Academy assigning them to a specialized training track based on their trial performance and personal aptitude.

**Setting:** The Main Courtyard. Rows of brass terminals. Faculty stationed at department tables. [[Dean Isolde Vane]] presiding from a floating podium (as in the Gen-Ed exam from S2).

**How it works:**
1. Students approach a terminal and receive their **recommended track** based on trial scores
2. They can **accept** the recommendation or **petition** for a different track (requires justification)
3. The party already proved themselves in Gen-Ed — they have some flexibility

---

### Academy Tracks

> [!NOTE]
> These tracks are suggestions designed to map Daggerheart classes to the Vumbua Academy fiction. Adjust names and flavour as needed.

| Academy Track | Daggerheart Archetype | Description | Department Head |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pathfinder Corps** | Ranger / Scout | Navigation, cartography, survival. The front line of exploration. | Senior Exploranaut [[hesperus\|Hesperus]] |
| **Harmonics Division** | Wizard / Sorcerer | Ether resonance, battery science, amplitude manipulation. The "magic" track. | [[professor-kante\|Professor Kante]] |
| **Ironworks Guild** | Guardian / Warrior | Combat, engineering, heavy machinery. Walkers, weapons, walls. | TBD |
| **Verdant Studies** | Druid / Seraph | Ecology, xenobiology, integration science. Working with living systems. | TBD |
| **Shadow Operations** | Rogue / Bard | Intelligence, diplomacy, infiltration. The "soft power" track. | TBD |
| **Medicae Corps** | Healer / Support | Field medicine, stress management, morale. Keeping teams alive. | TBD |

**Key Questions for Each PC:**

| PC | Likely Track | Why | Tension |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[[Ignatius]]** | Ironworks or Pathfinder | Fire-based combat, physical presence | Does he want to fight, or does he want to explore and prove Ash-Blood value? |
| **[[Iggy]]** | Harmonics | Already mentored by Kante, technical genius | Will Kante pull strings to get him? Does Iggy even understand what he's signing up for? |
| **[[Britt]]** | Verdant Studies or Pathfinder | Mizizi connection to living systems | Tension between studying *what she is* vs. blazing her own trail |
| **[[Aggie]]** | Verdant Studies or Shadow Ops | Mizizi ecology knowledge, practical wisdom | She may resist being "studied" — Shadow Ops lets her be an agent, not a specimen |
| **[[Lomi]]** | Ironworks | Boiler-room background, mechanical aptitude | The "worker track" — exactly where Harmony expects him. Does he accept or rebel? |

---

### Player Engagement

- **Let players discuss in-character** — this is a big life decision for their characters. Don't rush it.
- **NPCs weigh in** — Valentine might recommend his own track smugly. Ember might comment. Cassius is stressed about it.
- **The tracks create social dynamics** — PCs in the same track will share classes; PCs in different tracks will have separate adventures.
- **The ambush aftermath lingers** — did anyone report it? Are campus authorities asking questions? Does Azer's scheme become relevant here?

> [!WARNING]
> **Pacing check:** Phase 3 could easily absorb an entire session if players want to explore the class selection deeply. Consider whether this is a quick montage or a full scene depending on table energy.

---

## Open TODOs

> [!NOTE]
> Items that need GM decisions or future drafting:
> - [ ] **Lucky's test questions** — 10 questions with Val's annotated answers
> - [ ] **Track department heads** — Fill in TBD faculty for Ironworks, Verdant Studies, Shadow Ops, Medicae

### The Atmosphere: A City in Surge

The air in the Academy has shifted. The low-hum of study and exams has been replaced by a vibration that sits right in the teeth. This is the **Resonance Race**, and for one day, the school isn't an institution—it's a stadium.

- **Vibrant Energy:** Banners for the 12 teams hang from every balcony. The smell of ozone and street food (spiced skewers and "Reso-Corn") fills the air.
- **The Scale:** The Apex Ring isn't just a track; it's a geographic landmark. It holds **500,000 people**—nearly the entire population of the Academy and visiting Harmony citizens. Think the scale of the largest F1 or NASCAR stadiums, but with a mile-wide wilderness basin in the center.
- **The Sound:** A constant, rhythmic chanting of team names, punctuated by the high-pitched *whine* of rigs being tested in the distance.

---

### Phase 4: The Walk to the Apex

Getting to the race is a pilgrimage. The PCs must navigate the surging crowds of the **Spire-Scape** to reach the Southern Rim.

#### The Walk
- **The Surge:** Thousands of students and citizens dressed in team colors (blues, golds, and the deep reds of the Shatter Stampers). 
- **The Vendors:** "Scout-Spotter" brass binoculars for rent; unauthorized team jerseys; "Crystal-Cool" drinks that glow in the dark.
- **The Gate:** A massive triple-archway made of reclaimed hull-plates. Above it, a holographic scoreboard flickers with the current Global Amplitude.

#### The Gated Tiers (How to get seats)
As the PCs approach the gate, a **Loom Terminal** scans their student receipts.

1. **Gate A: The Bleacher-Walls (Standard)**
   - *Requirement:* All active students are granted access.
   - *Experience:* Stone steps, cramped but high-energy. The "Scout-Spotter" shouting match happens here.
2. **Gate B: The Rim-Tracker (Premium)**
   - *Requirement:* Requires a "Trolley Token" (5 copper) or a high trial rank (Top 10%).
   - *Experience:* Seating on the moving steam trolley. You follow the rigs as they move through the basin.
3. **Gate C: The Gilded Zephyrs (VIP)**
   - *Requirement:* Invitation only or [[House Gilded]] sponsorship.
   - *Experience:* Boarding an airship. Magnifying floors. Champagne and silk.

---

### The NPC Spectator Sandbox

The basin is a living ecosystem of agendas. Use this table as a "sandbox" for player interaction—they might spot an NPC through binoculars, bump into them at a Reso-Corn stand, or hear them shouting from another tier.

| NPC | Location | Visibility | Rooting For... | Rationale/Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **[[valentine-sterling|Valentine Sterling]]** | **Gilded Zephyrs** (VIP) | **Making a Scene** | *[[resonance-racers#Team 1 Shatter Stamper|Shatter Stamper]]* | Hovering directly over the Spires; narrating the race into a private recorder for "post-game analysis." |
| **[[ember|Ember]]** | **Bleacher-Walls** (South Rim) | **Incognito** | *[[resonance-racers#Team 5 Dancer Fabian|Dancer & Fabian]]* | Scribbling furiously in a notebook; avoiding [[ignatius|Ignatius]]'s eye if he's nearby. |
| **[[rill|Rill]]** | **Basin Floor** (The Pits) | **Open (Working)** | *[[resonance-racers#Team 5 Dancer Fabian|Dancer & Fabian]]* | Calibrating a battery for the next heat; looks exhausted. |
| **[[professor-ink|Professor Ink]]** | **Rim-Tracker** (East Rim) | **Open (Working)** | *None* | Using a magnifying lens to study simulated petrified trees. Doesn't even look at the rigs. |
| **[[professor-kante|Professor Kante]]** | **Research Deck** (North Rim) | **Incognito** | *[[resonance-racers#Team 4 Pudge|Pudge]]* | Watching the gryphon's metabolic-amplitude sync with a clinical intensity. |
| **[[lucky|Lucky]]** | **Bleacher-Walls** (West Rim) | **Making a Scene** | *The Leader* | Changing "Victory Flags" frantically. Currently shouting odds for a mid-race upset. |
| **[[cassius-thorne|Cassius Thorne]]** | **Bleacher-Walls** (East Rim) | **Making a Scene** | *[[resonance-racers#Team 1 Shatter Stamper|Shatter Stamper]]* | Shouting "CRUSH THEM!" every time a heavy rig gets near a smaller one. |
| **[[dean-isolde-vane|Dean Isolde Vane]]** | **Sky-Spire Balcony** | **Making a Scene** | *The Republic* | Standing perfectly still, watching the Global Amplitude gauge. A symbol of stability. |
| **[[percival-vane-smythe-iii|Percival Vane-Smythe III]]** | **Bleacher-Walls** (South Rim) | **Making a Scene** | *[[resonance-racers#Team 4 Pudge|Pudge]]* | Holding court. Explaining how the gryphon's flight "proves" there must be an Air Clan. |
| **[[iron-jaw-jax|Iron-Jaw Jax]]** | **Bleacher-Walls** (North Rim) | **Making a Scene** | *[[resonance-racers#Team 1 Shatter Stamper|Shatter Stamper]]* | Shaking the railings. Shouting technical advice that nobody below can possibly hear. |
| **[[nyx|Nyx]]** | **Rim-Tracker** (West Curve) | **Incognito** | *Sail & Stun* | Sitting silently with a hood up. Watching the teams' *timing*, not their speed. |
| **[[calculus-prime|Calculus Prime]]** | **Bleacher-Walls** (High Tier) | **Open** | *Statistical Average* | Projecting a HUD from its eyes; calculating the probable winner (currently 68.4% for [[resonance-racers#Team 1 Shatter Stamper|Shatter Stamper]]). |
| **[[sarge|Sarge]]** | **The Walkway** (Transit) | **Incognito** | *Safety* | Wearing a generic staff uniform; noting "blocked fire exits" and "unstable railings" instead of the race. |
| **[[cinder-4|Cinder-4]]** | **Bleacher-Walls** (West Rim) | **Open** | *None* | Staring intensely at the Ash-Blood simulation. Visibly vibrating with static anger at the missing Spire. |
| **[[hesperus|Hesperus]]** | **The Rim-Tracker** (South) | **Open** | *The Trainees* | Watching the *crowd* as much as the race. Gauging how the new intake handles the spectacle. |
| **[[celia-vance|Celia Vance]]** | **Gilded Zephyrs** (VIP) | **Incognito** | *None* | Managing logistics via a hand-held terminal. She’s effectively running the event from the air. |

---

### Serendipitous Meetings (Roleplay Hooks)

As the PCs move through the tiers or look through their binoculars:

1. **The Theorist's Crowd:** The PCs hear a familiar, high-pitched voice. **[[percival-vane-smythe-iii|Percy]]** is standing on a bench in the South Bleachers, cornering a confused freshman. *"But don't you see? The way the gryphon banks—it's drawing from a latent Aero-Static field that shouldn't exist! There's an Air Clan, I tell you!"*
2. **The Safety Hazard:** On the walk to their seats, the PCs are nearly knocked over by a "staff member" moving quickly. It's **[[sarge|Sarge]]**, swearing under his breath about the "total lack of structural redundancy on these temporary bleachers." 
3. **The Silent Watcher:** If the PCs use binoculars to scan the Rim-Tracker, they might spot **[[nyx|Nyx]]**. She isn't cheering; she's timing the rigs with a mechanical stopwatch. If she catches them looking, she simply pulls her hood lower and moves to the next car.
4. **The Merchant of Hype:** **[[lucky|Lucky]]** tried to sell them a "Shatter Stamper" flag five minutes ago. Now, he's sprinted around the rim and is trying to sell them a "Pudge" flag because they just hit a major node. *"Buy low! Buy low! Shatter's losing connection, Pudge is the new hotness!"*
5. **The Distant Gaze:** If an Ash-Blood PC (like **[[ignatius|Ignatius]]**) looks toward the West Bleachers, they see **[[cinder-4|Cinder-4]]**. They aren't watching the race; they are staring at the simulated Ash-Blood Isles terrain with a look of profound, mechanical mourning.

### Scene: The Resonance Race

> **Full reference:** See [[circuit-run|The Circuit-Run]] for the complete compendium (rules, energy system, node spectrum, craft types, viewing tiers).

#### The Racing Field (Notable Entries)

| Team / Soloist | Rig Type / Vehicle Description | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| **[[resonance-racers#Team 1 Shatter Stamper|Shatter Stamper]]** (Team 1) | **Heavy-Class (The Ironclad):** A massive, brutalist heavy rig. It resembles a fortified bunker on treads, built purely for straight-line momentum and surviving massive impacts. It lacks maneuverability but compensates with sheer armor. | High-yield nodes & brute force. Bulldozing obstacles rather than steering around them. |
| **[[resonance-racers#Team 3 Marble Wall|Marble Wall]]** (Team 3) | **Aggro/Hunter (The Bastion):** Reinforced crawler covered in reactive armor plating. It's built like a mobile blockade, bristling with kinetic dampeners. Less a racing vehicle, more a weaponized wall. | Attrition. Hunting and destroying smaller, faster rigs. Winning by being the last functional rig. |
| **[[resonance-racers#Team 4 Pudge|Pudge]]** (Team 4) | **Experimental (The Gryphon-Hybrid):** A bulbous, highly customized gyro-boat. It looks aerodynamically questionable ("pudgy") but features experimental Aero-Static wings that allow it to catch thermals and glide. | Massive sync duration & high vertical jumps to bypass complex terrain entirely. |
| **[[resonance-racers#Team 5 Dancer Fabian|Dancer & Fabian]]** (Team 5) | **Precision (The Glass-Sail):** A beautifully crafted, lightweight racing sailboat. It has the lowest power rating but features incredibly precise steering mechanisms and a hull capable of minor resonant-phasing to slip through narrow gaps. | Extreme agility, tight evasion, technical drafting, and striking specific nodes. |
| **[[resonance-racers#Stinger|Stinger]]** (Soloist) | **Minimalist (Hover-Bike):** A razor-thin engine strapped to a seat. It consists of little more than a high-output battery, a propulsion vent, and a forward-mounted Harvest-Prong. | Extreme speed, weaving through the chaos. Relies entirely on evasion and not getting hit. |
| **[[resonance-racers#Goliath|Goliath]]** (Soloist) | **Super-Heavy (Land-Ship):** A mobile fortress. It is astronomically large for a soloist entry, dominating the canyon floor with its sheer width and multi-tread propulsion system. | Survive "The Drop" and act as a moving hazard. Slow but virtually indestructible by standard rigs. |

The **first Resonance Race of the intake year** is the biggest social event at [[Vumbua Academy]]. The entire campus empties into the **Apex Ring** — a mile-wide basin of simulated wilderness where teams race to strike Spires, siphon node energy, and light the Grand Resonator at the centre.

**Why this year is special:**
- The arena terrain has been **updated for the first time** to include the **Ash-Blood Isles** and the **Mizizi Forest island** — the two newest integrated territories
- The entire student body is seeing simulated versions of these lands for the first time
- **However:** There is no Ash-Blood Node in the arena. The [[scrivener-guild|Scrivener Guild]] claims the resonance data isn't finalised. This is a sore point — especially for Ash-Blood students like **[[ignatius|Ignatius]]**.

**How the PCs experience it:**
- As first-years, they're in the **Bleacher-Walls** (stone amphitheaters on the basin rim)
- They can use brass binoculars and act as **Scout-Spotters** — shouting node coordinates to teams below
- The Rim-Tracker trolley passes by periodically — they can hop on to follow the action
- The **Gilded Zephyrs** (luxury airships with magnifying glass floors) float overhead — a visible reminder of Harmony's class structure

**Key Dramatic Moments (GM picks 2-3):**

1. **The Drop:** Rigs are physically slung or dropped from the amphitheater rim. The initial burst of momentum is all they get before they must strike their first Spire. A massive land-ship ("Goliath") nearly crushes a soloist ("Stinger") on the way down.

2. **The Sync:** A team strikes a Leidian node and gains the **Overclock** boon — extreme speed with a "Phase-Dash" teleport. The crowd roars. But the heat stress is visible — the rig's hull glows cherry-red.

3. **The Missing Node:** **[[ignatius|Ignatius]]** notices the Ash-Blood Isles terrain is there, but there's no Ash-Blood Spire. If he asks **[[professor-kante|Professor Kante]]** (or any faculty), the answer is evasive: *"The data isn't finalised."* This connects directly to the [[The Power System|Ash-Blood Anomaly]] — the integration only produced ~20 amps instead of the expected +300 to +800.

4. **The Battery Lesson:** For students who paid attention in class (especially **[[iggy|Iggy]]**), the race is a live demonstration of everything **[[professor-kante|Professor Kante]]** teaches. Stored connection, not stored energy. The umber crystal gutter creating an artificial dead zone. The relationship between power draw and nodes needed. *This is the exam in practice.*

5. **Marble Wall vs Dancer & Fabian:** The heavy team smashes through a contested area, destroying a smaller rig. The couple in the racing sailboat (lowest power rating in the field) has to surrender when they encounter the Wall. But they were so close — they only needed two more minor nodes.

6. **The Win:** The Grand Resonator lights up. A pillar of light erupts from the centre of the basin. The crowd goes absolutely berserk. The winning team's Harvest-Prong is still crackling with residual resonance as they're hoisted onto shoulders.

**GM Pacing Notes:**
- This is a **montage scene**, not a mechanical encounter
- Run it as a series of vivid descriptions with crowd reactions. 10-15 minutes max.
- Give each PC one moment of reaction or observation — **[[iggy|Iggy]]** noticing the missing node, **[[britt|Britt]]** recognising the simulated Mizizi terrain, **[[lomi|Lomi]]** sizing up the engineering, etc.
- The race sets up future plot threads: the Ash-Blood data mystery, the connection/energy distinction, the Captains watching from above

### Play-by-Play: The First Vumbua Circuit-Run

**1. The Launch**
The air is heavy with the smell of ozone and hot copper. Twelve teams are slung from the Southern Rim. **[[resonance-racers#Team 1 Shatter Stamper|Shatter Stamper]]** (Team 1) gets a massive launch, their heavy rig slamming down onto the canyon floor with a bone-shaking thud. **[[resonance-racers#Team 4 Pudge|Pudge]]** (Team 4) takes a more vertical drop, their gyro-boat catching a thermal and gliding over the petrified treetops.

**2. The First Sync**
**[[resonance-racers#Team 1 Shatter Stamper|Shatter Stamper]]** reaches the first Aero-Static spire. Their Harvest-Prong strikes — a massive flash of blue light. The Rig suddenly loses 90% of its weight, allowing it to leap a canyon wall that would have stopped it dead.
Behind them, **[[resonance-racers#Team 3 Marble Wall|Marble Wall]]** (Team 3) isn't racing; they're hunting. They ignore the first spires and instead ram into a soloist team, pinning them against the petrified bark. *"Strategy: Destroy first, collect later."*

**3. The Mid-Match Chaos**
The "Loom-Pulse" triggers. New Spires erupt from the ground. A Crystalline node appears right in front of **[[resonance-racers#Team 5 Dancer Fabian|Dancer & Fabian]]** (Team 5). They strike it, their sailboat hull turning into semi-fluid glass. They pass right through a narrow crack in the canyon wall that **[[resonance-racers#Team 1 Shatter Stamper|Shatter Stamper]]** has to go around.
Meanwhile, **[[resonance-racers#Team 4 Pudge|Pudge]]** is struggling. Their gryphon-hybrid requires massive connection to overcome its handicap. They strike a Vitruvian node, doubling their sync duration, but they're still behind the Global Amplitude line.

**4. The Final Stretch**
Only three teams left in contention for the Grand Resonator. **[[resonance-racers#Team 3 Marble Wall|Marble Wall]]** is bearing down on **[[resonance-racers#Team 5 Dancer Fabian|Dancer & Fabian]]**. Fabian is at the rudder, Dancer is on the Harvest-Prong. They hit a Kinetic-Echo spire, leaving a hard-light trail. As **[[resonance-racers#Team 3 Marble Wall|Marble Wall]]** prepares to ram, **[[resonance-racers#Team 5 Dancer Fabian|Dancer & Fabian]]** perform an instant U-turn on their own trail, letting the heavy rig sail past into a canyon wall.

**5. The Grand Resonator**
**[[resonance-racers#Team 4 Pudge|Pudge]]** finally hits the needed amplitude. The gyro-boat’s battery glows brilliant purple. With a final Aero-Static jump, they soar over the crowd, landing directly in front of the Grand Resonator.
**Strike!** The discharge creates a blinding pillar of light that illuminates the entire basin. **[[resonance-racers#Team 4 Pudge|Pudge]] wins!**
The crowd erupts. Valerius is shouting over the radio. The Captains in the Zephyrs are leaning over their magnifying floors, marking their tally sheets.

---

### Scene: Finding Rill

**The Setup:** The PCs need to find **[[rill|Rill]]** — she invited **[[britt|Britt]]** and **[[aggie|Aggie]]** to visit her at the grass-covered building near [[block-99|Block 99]] back in Session 2. But when they arrive, she's not there. She's busy prepping for the opening Resonance Race.

**Finding her requires effort:**
- Her usual spot (the grass-covered building inset into the hill) is **empty**. Bark samples are scattered on the desk, half-finished notes, a cold cup of something fungal.
- If PCs ask around: *"Rill? She's been running between the Basin and the Fungal Labs all morning. Something about calibrations."*
- If PCs check the Fungal Labs: She's there with **[[professor-ink|Professor Ink]]** — the [[scrivener-guild|Scrivener Guild]] Captain and fungal biology specialist. They're hunched over what looks like living moss samples, arguing about "resonance frequencies in petrified bark."

**The Encounter:**

When the PCs finally track her down, Rill is distracted, stressed, and clearly conflicted. She's happy to see [[Britt]] and [[Aggie]] — but there's guilt behind the smile.

**What Rill reveals (if pushed):**

1. **The Journey:** She and **[[professor-ink|Professor Ink]]** are planning an expedition **back into the [[mizizi-petrified-forest|Mizizi Petrified Forest]]**. Ink wants to study the trees — specifically what they *remember*. Rill wants to find a cure for the "Eternal Growth" corruption affecting the [[mizizi|Mizizi]].

2. **Her Shame:** Rill left the Forest two years ago. The [[Mizizi]] see her as a **traitor**. She didn't just leave — she was the first to walk out. To go *back*, escorted by a Harmony academic... that's going to feel like an invasion to the Elders.

   > *"I know what they'll say. 'She left, and now she brings outsiders.' But Ink can see things in the bark that I can't. The trees are dying, [[britt|Britt]]. Slowly. And the Elders won't let anyone help because they think stagnation IS health."*

3. **Her Secret (GM discretion):** Rill is secretly [[Wadi]], not [[Mizizi]]. Her River Clan heritage gives her a different perspective on "Flow" vs "Stagnation" — it's why she can solve problems true Mizizi cannot. She won't reveal this unless deeply trusted.

4. **The Danger:** The heart of the [[Mizizi Petrified Forest]] is **protected**. The deeper you go, the more dangerous it gets:
   - **Hallucinations** — the forest's defence mechanism. The petrified trees project visions that confuse intruders
   - **Beasts** — creatures adapted to live in the hallucinogenic environment, potentially immune to the confusion
   - **The Elders** — the Mizizi leadership doesn't welcome visitors. They may view Rill's return as a threat

**Emotional Stakes:**
- For **[[britt|Britt]]**/**[[aggie|Aggie]]**: Rill is the only other Mizizi they know at the Academy. She's asking them to understand why she left — and maybe to support her return.
- For **other PCs**: This is a window into Mizizi culture, the Petrified Forest's dangers, and a future quest hook.
- For **Rill**: She's torn between her excitement about the journey and her terror of what she'll face when she gets there. She's also trying to manage Zephyr, prep the Resonance Race, and assist the Dean — she's stretched thin.

**Professor Ink — Quick Reference:**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | [[scrivener-guild|Scrivener Guild]] Captain |
| **Specialty** | Fungal biology, petrified bark analysis |
| **Personality** | Pure thirst for knowledge. Academic to the bone. Loves [[Iggy]]'s curiosity but is genuinely afraid [[Ignatius]] will burn his specimens. |
| **Motivation** | The trees of the [[Mizizi Petrified Forest]] may be the oldest living records in Harmony. If they're *remembering* something, Ink wants to know what. |
| **Relationship to Rill** | Research partners. He provides the scientific rigour; she provides the cultural context and access. |

**GM Notes:**
- This scene should feel **quiet and personal** — a contrast to the party and the ambush. It's a conversation, not an encounter.
- Don't force Rill to reveal everything. Let the PCs earn her trust through roleplay.
- If a PC offers to help with the forest expedition, that's a **major future quest hook** — flag it.
- If [[Iggy]] is present, Professor Ink will light up. There's a natural bond there.

---

## Phase 5: The Exam

### Scene: The Written Exam

**The Venue — The Basin:**

The Resonance Race basin doubles as the largest classroom in Harmony. A **mile-wide** open-air stadium, with terminals set up along the upper tiers. The remaining **~70,000 students** file in and take their seats at individual testing stations.

The scale is staggering. The Basin can hold far more than 70k — it was built for the Race, and the exam is just borrowing the space. Students sit in long stretches around the upper rim, each with a terminal. The basin floor far below is empty — for now.

**The Exam Format:**
- Terminal-based written exam
- Multiple-choice and short-answer using [[The Loom]]-connected terminals
- Questions cover the first week of general education: resonance theory, node science, navigation basics, survival protocol
- **~20,000 students will fail** and be sent home

> [!NOTE]
> **TODO:** Create Lucky's test questions — 10 questions with Val's annotated answers. This is the comedic/practical prep from Phase 1 paying off.

**GM Pressure Points:**
- The PCs should feel the weight of 70,000 people taking the same exam
- If they studied (or got Val's cheat sheet, or talked to Rill about Weeping Nodes), they have advantages
- The exam itself should be **quick in real-time** — don't simulate every question. Hit 2-3 key moments with dice rolls, then move to results

---

### Scene: The Drop

**The spectacle of failure.**

The **20,000 students who failed** get one consolation: they're allowed to **drop into the Basin** — the only way to set foot on the storied basin floor. They walk to the rim, step off, and slide/drop down the concave walls to the basin floor below.

From there, they walk out through the front gate and straight to port. Ships are waiting. It's the most dignified exit the Academy can offer — you failed, but you got to touch the floor that legends race on.

**For the PCs:**
- This is **cinematic**. Describe 20,000 people slowly walking to the edge and dropping in. Some are crying. Some are laughing. Some are determined to come back.
- The PCs *passed*. They're watching this from the upper tiers. It should feel heavy.

**For the PCs who passed:**
- They're told they can descend into the Basin too, if they want — to get a head start on exploring the space where they'll eventually need to impress the Captains.
- This is optional. Some students sprint down. Others linger, watching the failed candidates walk to port.

---

### Scene: Team Assignment & The Loom

**The Loom speaks.**

After the exam, the remaining **~50,000 students** receive their team assignments. The [[The Loom|Loom]] — the ancient engine in the [[Walker-Core]] that powers the Academy's systems — assigns each student to a squad.

**How it works:**
- Each student approaches a Loom terminal (or the assignment appears on their existing exam screen)
- The Loom delivers a **one-liner** — a short, cryptic statement that serves as both assignment and prophecy
- Students with matching one-liners are on the same team

**Example Loom one-liners** (for the PC squad):
- *"The fire that doesn't burn feeds the root that doesn't grow."* → Ignatius + Britt?
- *"What sinks in still water rises in the current."* → Aggie + Iggy?
- *"The hammer asks the mountain: who shaped whom?"* → Lomi?

> [!NOTE]
> **GM Decision:** Craft the actual Loom one-liners for each PC. These should feel like fortune-cookie-meets-prophecy — short, poetic, and thematically tied to the character's arc.

**What happens next:**
- Students are told they can now **prepare to see the Captains**
- A rest week follows, during which teams interview with available Captains for their first **venture journey** — a one-month trial expedition
- The best Captains take the highest-ranked candidates. Your team's initial ranking determines your options
- Each PC's clan suggested a Captain in the first survey — that's their "recommended" match

**GM Notes:**
- The team assignment should feel **momentous** — this is the party officially forming
- The Loom is ancient and somewhat mysterious. Its one-liners are never wrong, but they're often only understood in retrospect
- Leave the Captain interviews for Session 4 — this session ends on the team forming
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
