# Session 3 Planning

## Goals
- **The Celestial Lounge**: Late-night social encounter before exams—winding down, character moments.
- **The Ambush**: Combat encounter on the way back to dorms.
- **Morning After**: Long rest → first day of class selection.

---

## Phase 1: The Celestial Lounge

### Setting

**Location:** [[celestial-lounge|The Celestial Lounge]] — top floor of the tallest building in the northwest "fancy district" of [[Vumbua Academy]].

**Time:** Very late at night—the party is winding down when the PCs arrive. Most students are tired and heading out. The late hour matters: exams are tomorrow.

**Mood:** Warm amber light, soft music fading, empty glasses on tables. The glamour of earlier in the evening is giving way to yawns and goodbyes. A few diehards cling to the night.

---

### Key NPCs

#### [[valentine-sterling|Valentine "Val" Sterling]] — The Host

Val is hosting the gathering and is one of the last people still animated and awake despite the late hour. He feels supremely well-prepared for tomorrow's exams—he even bought one of [[Lucky]]'s test answer packets out of curiosity. He found it to be a decent estimation of the real exam, but wouldn't rely on it alone; he spotted some flaws in the answers.

**What Val wants right now:**
- He's trying to get someone—*anyone*—to play one more round, but everyone is tired and leaving.
- He just wants to make his papa ([[valentine-sterling-sr|Valentine Sterling Sr.]]) proud.

**Val's Test Answers** *(potential RP hook)*:
> [!NOTE]
> **TODO:** Pull 10 questions from Lucky's test and provide Val's annotated answers—where he agrees, where he found flaws, and what the *real* answers should be. This could be a handout or RP conversation.

- He offers **two games** — players can pick one or play both.

---

### 🎲 Game 1: "Crown & Ruin" *(Push-Your-Luck Dice Game)*

**What it teaches:** The Hope/Fear dice, Stress accumulation, Hope/Fear token economy.

**The Drink:** A tray of "Void Shots" — a glowing, bitter Academy drink that burns going down. **Every time you mark a Stress in this game, you take a shot in-fiction.** Val pours with a grin.

#### Rules

1. Players take turns rolling the **Hope die and Fear die** (the actual 2d12).
2. **If Hope ≥ Fear:** You bank the difference as points. Earn a **Hope token** (real — you keep this).
3. **If Fear > Hope:** You **take a shot and mark a Stress.** The GM earns a **Fear token.**
4. **If they match (doubles):** *"Crown & Ruin!"* — Choose: **double your banked points** OR **lose them all.** (Teaches risk assessment.)
5. After each roll, you can **stop and bank your points** or **push for another roll.**
6. **First to 20 points wins.**
7. **If you hit 3 Stress, you're bust** — you're out of the round, slumped over the table.

#### GM Notes

- Keep it **fast** — 2-3 rounds max. This is a warm-up, not the main event.
- The Hope/Fear tokens they earn are **real and persist** — they carry into the ambush scene. This makes the game feel consequential.
- If a PC busts out at 3 Stress, that Stress carries forward too. The shots were real. The hangover is real.

#### How the NPCs Play

**Valentine — The Showman**
- **Never banks early.** He'll push to the edge and grin. *"Banking already? How very... cautious of you."*
- **Light-hearted trash talk.** He's not mean — he's *entertaining.* He narrates his rolls like a radio commentator: *"And Sterling rolls again! The crowd goes wild! The dice—oh. Oh no."*
- **Takes his shots with style.** When he marks Stress, he raises the glass, toasts the table, and drinks with a wince he immediately masks. *"Perfectly fine. That one tasted like victory. Delayed victory."*
- **Strategically clever.** He watches other players' risk tolerance and adjusts his commentary to pressure cautious players into pushing: *"You know, my father always said — Fortune doesn't wait for the timid."*
- **If he busts out:** He takes it with exaggerated grace: *"I believe... the room is tilting. That means I've won at something."*

**Ember — The Overachiever**
- **Ultra-aggressive.** She pushes *every single time.* She doesn't understand the concept of banking — it feels like cowardice to her.
- **Treats it like an exam.** She's not playing for fun — she's playing to *prove* she belongs at this table, at this party, in Harmony. Every win is validation.
- **Takes her shots like medicine.** Slams them back without flinching, then immediately asks whose turn it is. No time for sentiment.
- **Observant and calculating.** Despite her aggression, she's watching everyone's tells carefully. She notices who hesitates, who flinches at the dice, who looks at their banked points.
- **Trying too hard to fit in.** She laughs a beat too late at Val's jokes. She uses Harmony slang slightly wrong. She's desperate to be seen as *one of them,* not "the Ash-Blood girl."
- **If she busts out:** Her composure cracks. A flash of genuine frustration — she wanted to win *so badly.* She covers it quickly: *"Again. Let's go again."*

---

### 🃏 Game 2: "Truths & Treachery" *(Truth-or-Lie Social Game)*

**What it teaches:** Contested rolls, how different stats work against each other, retcon narration.

**The Drink:** Same Void Shots. **You take a shot (mark Stress) if you guess wrong.**

#### Rules

1. One player is the **Teller.** They tell the table something about themselves, their clan, their past — **either completely true or a total lie.**
2. The Teller makes a **Presence roll** (stat + 2d12) — this is their "poker face" score. *They do NOT reveal the number yet.*
3. Every other player makes an **Instinct roll** (stat + 2d12) — this is their "read" on the Teller.
4. **The Teller reveals the truth:** Was it real or a lie?
5. **Compare rolls after the reveal:**
   - If your Instinct roll **≥ the Teller's Presence roll**, you guessed correctly. Earn a **Hope token.**
   - If your Instinct roll **< the Teller's Presence roll**, you guessed wrong. **Take a shot. Mark Stress.**
6. **Retcon the guesses:** After the reveal, players narrate what their character's reaction was *in the moment*. The GM asks: *"So [PC], when they said that — what did you think? Did you buy it?"* Players whose rolls succeeded get to say they saw through it; players who failed get to describe being fooled.

#### Why the Retcon Works

- The GM doesn't need to manage a guessing phase — just let everyone roll, reveal, then narrate retroactively.
- This is how Daggerheart handles many social situations: roll first, narrate the fiction to match.
- It lets players practice **collaborative storytelling** — they build the scene after the dice tell them the outcome.
- **Bonus:** Players learn things about each other's backstories through the truths and lies. This is *actual character development* disguised as a drinking game.

#### GM Notes

- Val and Ember go first to demonstrate the format. Then PCs take turns.
- Encourage players to use **real backstory** for their truths — this is free character-building.
- NPC statements are pre-written below — pick 2-3 for each NPC depending on time.
- **Ember is taking mental notes for Valerius's radio show.** Anything juicy the PCs reveal may appear on air later.

#### How the NPCs Play

**Valentine — The Smooth Operator**
- Val treats T&T like a performance. He leans back, steeples his fingers, and delivers each statement like a theatre monologue.
- **High Presence.** He's *genuinely good at lying* — smooth voice, steady eye contact, confident rhythm. His poker face is championship-level.
- **Strategically vulnerable.** He mixes real emotional truths with outrageous lies, making it hard to tell which is which. He *wants* people to underestimate his sincerity.
- When he reads others, he does it with a raised eyebrow and a knowing smile: *"Interesting. Very interesting."*
- **If caught in a lie:** Takes the shot gracefully. *"Well played. I almost had you."*
- **If his truth is doubted:** Genuine flash of hurt he quickly masks. A crack in the armour.

**Ember — The Intensity**
- Ember treats T&T like an interrogation. She leans forward, studies faces, barely blinks.
- **Low Presence, high Instinct.** She's bad at lying (too intense, too earnest) but *excellent* at reading others. She stares right through people.
- When someone tells their statement, Ember is visibly analysing — head tilted, eyes narrowed. She looks like she's trying to decode them.
- **Trying to fit in.** She wants to be fun and casual about it, but she can't help being competitive. She'll say something like *"This is such a fun game!"* with the energy of someone filing a police report.
- **If she guesses wrong:** Takes the shot fast, then immediately explains her reasoning to nobody: *"No, but see, the way you said it — the cadence was—"*
- **When it's her turn to tell:** She gets nervous. These truths cut close to home. Her voice drops. She stops performing.

---

#### Valentine's Statements

| # | Statement | Truth/Lie | Weight | GM Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | *"The [[House Gilded\|Gilded]] Crystal Banks are running out of reserves. If the Global Amplitude doesn't surge soon, the lights go out — and so does my family's fortune."* | **TRUTH** | 🔴 Big | This is real — the Crystal Banks are insolvent (see [[house-gilded]]). Val knows because he's a Sterling. Delivers it lightly, like it's gossip, but the weight lands. |
| 2 | *"Honestly? I'm here to make my papa proud more than anything else. I like people more than places. I'm not sure I'll make a great explorer."* | **TRUTH** | 🟡 Mid | Genuine vulnerability. He's a social creature forced into an explorer's path. The room gets quiet. Ember looks at him differently. |
| 3 | *"My cousin Valerius started his radio show after he failed out of the Academy. Couldn't hack it as an Exploranaut, so he picked up a microphone instead."* | **LIE** | 🟡 Mid | Valerius actually graduated — barely, but he did. Val spreads this lie because the rivalry is real and Valerius's ego is a fat target. |
| 4 | *"My father once stole a [[Mizizi]] sapling in the middle of the night. Planted it in our courtyard. It died within a week."* | **LIE** | 🟠 Fun | Pure fabrication — Val Sr. is many things but not a botanist. Val delivers it with total sincerity to make it funnier when revealed. |
| 5 | *"I bought one of [[Lucky]]'s answer packets for tomorrow's exam. Half the answers are wrong. The 'Battle of the Six Sails' question? Complete fiction."* | **TRUTH** | 🟢 Light | He did buy it, and he did find errors. Low-stakes truth that demonstrates the game format and seeds the Lucky's test hook. |
| 6 | *"My hands have never touched actual dirt. Not once. They're magically treated to look weathered."* | **TRUTH** | 🟡 Mid | This is actually true (see GM notes on his character sheet) — but it sounds so absurd nobody believes it. Val plays it for laughs. |

> **Recommended order:** Start with #5 (light, demonstrates format), then #3 or #4 (fun lies), build to #1 or #2 (emotional weight).

---

#### Ember's Statements

| # | Statement | Truth/Lie | Weight | GM Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | *"The clean fire of Harmony — the crystal energy — it feels more alive to me than the heat of the volcano ever did. The first time I held a battery, I felt... home."* | **TRUTH** | 🔴 Big | This is her deepest truth and the core of her character tension. She means it. Her voice is quiet. If [[Ignatius]] is at the table, this lands like a bomb. |
| 2 | *"Before I came to Vumbua, I'd already started dressing like a Harmony citizen. I was ashamed of fitting in here more than I ever fit in at home."* | **TRUTH** | 🟡 Mid | She's been a modernizer since before the Academy. This isn't new — it's who she's always been. The shame is real. |
| 3 | *"I work for Valerius because he feeds me well. Best meals I've ever had. That's the whole arrangement."* | **LIE** | 🟡 Mid | She works for Valerius because she *admires* him — his command of words, his confidence, his ability to be Harmony-passing. The food is fine. The real payment is belonging. |
| 4 | *"Back on the Isles, I set fire to a warehouse full of traditional fire-oil. On purpose. As a statement."* | **LIE** | 🟠 Fun | Pure invention — Ember is rebellious in spirit but not destructive. She tells this lie because she wants to seem bold and dangerous. The delivery is too intense. Easy to catch. |
| 5 | *"My cousin—"* (she glances at [[Ignatius]]) *"—used to catch salamanders and name them after types of rock. He had one called Igneous. It was the ugliest."* | **TRUTH** | 🟢 Light | A childhood memory. Endearing. Humanizes both Ember and Ignatius. If Ignatius is here, he'll either confirm or deny — either way it's gold. |
| 6 | *"Valerius told me that if I bring him a good enough story tonight, he'll give me my own segment on the show. 'Ember's Embers.' Three minutes, once a week."* | **TRUTH** | 🟡 Mid | This is real — and it reveals her ambition. She doesn't just want to report for Valerius. She wants her own voice. The segment name is embarrassing and she knows it. |

> **Recommended order:** Start with #5 (light, connects to Ignatius), then #4 or #3 (lies), build to #1 or #2 (emotional gut-punches).

---

### Val's Pitch

> *Valentine sets two bottles on the table: one glowing faintly blue, one amber. He grins.*
>
> *"Two games. Pick your poison — literally. Crown & Ruin if you like dice and danger. Truths & Treachery if you think you can lie to my face. Or..."* He leans forward. *"We play both. Winners of Crown buy the next round for Treachery."*



**Player Engagement:**
- Val challenges PCs to play — a chance to bond or rival with him.
- The games are **mechanical tutorials** disguised as roleplay. By the end, players understand Hope/Fear dice, Stress, contested rolls, and spending Hope.
- If PCs ask about the exam, he'll share his analysis of Lucky's test between rounds.
- Callback to Session 1: He remembers [[Ignatius]] from the courtyard handshake incident and may reference it—awkward or playful depending on how PCs approach.

---

#### [[ember|Ember]] — Valerius's Reporter *(First On-Screen Appearance)*

Ember is an [[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]] student and [[Ignatius]]'s childhood cousin. She is attending the Celestial Lounge as a field reporter for [[valerius-sterling|Valerius Sterling]]'s radio show.

**Why this works for Ember:**
- She's an Ash-Blood who loves the majesty and lore of Harmony—fascinated by the culture, not resentful of it.
- What better way to immerse herself than by sitting on Valerius's staff, being his eyes and ears for juicy gossip?
- This puts her squarely in the "modernizer" camp: embracing Harmony's world while other Ash-Bloods cling to tradition.

**What Ember is doing:**
- Observing the party, taking mental notes or scribbling on a small pad.
- She's not hiding—she's openly working. Students may or may not know she reports to Valerius.

**Player Engagement:**
- [[Ignatius]] encountering his cousin working for a Harmony radio host could be a charged moment—does he see it as betrayal or pragmatism?
- She represents the cultural divide within the [[Ash-Bloods]]: modernizers vs. traditionalists.
- She may try to interview the PCs for the show—giving players a choice about their public image.

---

#### [[valerius-sterling|Valerius Sterling]] — The Absent Voice

Valerius himself is **not** physically present at the Celestial Lounge. However, he has scouts (including Ember) watching the event and reporting back in case there's any juicy gossip for his radio show.

**GM Note:** Anything noteworthy the PCs do tonight may end up on Valerius's next broadcast—a fun consequence to carry forward.

---

### Scene Flow

1. **Arrival** — PCs enter the Celestial Lounge as it's winding down. Describe the fading glamour, sleepy students, emptying tables.
2. **Valentine's Invitation** — Val spots the party and tries to rope them into playing his game. He's friendly, energetic, slightly desperate for company.
3. **Ember Encounter** — PCs notice (or are noticed by) Ember. She's taking notes. If Ignatius is present, this is a family reunion moment.
4. **Exam Talk** — Conversation may drift to tomorrow's exams. Val shares his take on Lucky's test answers. Ember might fish for a quote.
5. **Winding Down** — The Lounge empties further. PCs decide when to leave—setting up the transition to the Ambush.

---

### The Pressure to Leave

> Put the pressure on them to head to bed. If they stay out too late, start marking **Stress**!

The Celestial Lounge staff begin closing up. Other students give the PCs looks—*"You know exams are tomorrow, right?"* The smart move is to leave. The late hour is the ticking clock.

---

## Phase 2: The Ambush

### Setting

**Location:** A dark stretch of campus between the Celestial Lounge and the dorms — perhaps an unlit courtyard or maintenance corridor. Late at night, few witnesses.

**Time:** After the PCs leave the Celestial Lounge. The campus is quiet, most students already in bed before exams.

**Mood:** Sudden shift from warm social energy to cold, tense danger. Shadows, silence, then violence.

---

### The Situation

The PCs are ambushed by **Tus** and **Zyykl**, two burly young men from [[Nstyl]] — the Silent Silt city where sound is physically impossible and everyone communicates through sign language. They don't speak; they *can't* speak. They just attack.

But Tus and Zyykl aren't the real threat — they've been **manipulated** by **Azor**, a street-smart schemer from [[Settika]] who used [[Prism Falls]] water to convince them this was their only shot at redemption.

---

### Azor's Scheme

**The Setup:** Tus and Zyykl both **failed out of the first round of entrance exams.** They're devastated — they came all the way from [[Nstyl]] to prove themselves, and they believed in the Academy more than anything.

**The Con:** Azor tracked them down and used water from [[Prism Falls]] (Settika's node resource — water that reveals the true nature of whatever it touches). He told them:

> *"I know what you really are. The water showed me. You're Exploranauts — real ones. The test was wrong. All you need is a receipt from a current student, and you can retake the exam. The Academy will see they failed the wrong people."*

Tus and Zyykl **believe in the power of the Prism Falls**. Back in [[Nstyl]], Settika's water is respected, almost sacred. If the water says they're Exploranauts, they must be. They're naive, earnest, and desperate.

**The Truth:** Azor knows this won't work. The [[The Loom|Loom]] receipts aren't transferable IDs — they're point-in-time documents. The Loom recognises students based on how they interact with it, not by a piece of paper. Azor doesn't care about helping Tus and Zyykl. He's a mugger, plain and simple.

**The Real Plan:** Azor figured that the only students dumb enough to be out this late — the night before the most important week of most people's lives — would be the **rich and drunk ones.** Prudent students would be asleep. So he waits in the shadows, lets Tus and Zyykl do the dangerous work, and plans to take whatever valuables fall out of pockets during the scuffle.

---

### Key NPCs

#### Azor — The Man from Settika

A world-wise, street-smart manipulator from [[Settika]]. He knows how things work — Loom receipts, Academy bureaucracy, Prism Falls water. He uses that knowledge to exploit people who don't.

**Key traits:**
- **Sneaky and manipulative** — operates through proxies, never gets his hands dirty.
- **Not from a clan** — he's a city kid from [[Settika]], where the Prism Falls resource is just another tool.
- **Knows the con doesn't work** — he told Tus and Zyykl what they wanted to hear. The receipts are worthless.
- **Actual goal:** Mug rich students and disappear before morning.

**During the fight:**
- Azor is **watching from the shadows**, not engaging directly. He lets Tus and Zyykl take the risk.
- If the fight goes badly (PCs are too strong), he may slip away entirely — a loose thread for later.
- If the PCs are losing, he may step in to grab a crystal battery or coin purse.

#### Tus & Zyykl — The Nstyl Brothers

Two large, powerful young men from [[Nstyl]], the city with [[harmony-nodes#13 Nstyl|Silent Silt]] — where all sound is absorbed and everyone communicates through sign language. They will not speak during the encounter because they physically cannot — spoken language doesn't exist in their world.

**Key traits:**
- **Sign language only** — the PCs can't reason with them verbally. A PC who knows sign language could potentially communicate.
- **Names are gestures, not words** — "Tus" and "Zyykl" are outsider approximations of their hand-sign names. Different people pronounce them differently. (See [[harmony-nodes#13 Nstyl|Nstyl naming conventions]].)
- **Naive, not evil** — they genuinely believe they're supposed to be Academy students. Azor used Prism Falls water to convince them. They think they're *reclaiming* something that was wrongly taken.
- **Failed the entrance exam** — they're heartbroken about it. This isn't rage; it's desperation.
- **Burly and strong** — these are big boys. Farm-strong from the Nstyl quarries. Built for labour, not subtlety.
- **If defeated:** They seem confused and ashamed. Once the adrenaline fades, they realise something is wrong. If a PC can communicate in sign language, Tus will try to explain — *"The water said we were real. The man said the paper would prove it."*

---

### Encounter Composition

Based on Daggerheart SRD p76-77 (Jagged Knife adversaries), reskinned:

- **Azor** → Jagged Knife **Lieutenant** (the manipulator in the shadows)
- **Tus & Zyykl** → Jagged Knife **Lackey** ×2 groups (the muscle)

![[Screenshot_20260222_180117_OneDrive.jpg]]

#### Azor — Reskinned Jagged Knife Lieutenant *(×1)*

> *Tier 1 Leader — "The Man from Settika"*

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Difficulty** | 13 |
| **Thresholds** | 7/14 |
| **HP** | 6 |
| **Stress** | 3 |
| **ATK** | +2 |
| **Weapon** | Close | 1d8+3 phy |
| **Experience** | Streetwise +2, Deception +2 |

**Features:**
- **Puppeteer — Action:** When you spotlight Azor, **mark a Stress** to also spotlight Tus or Zyykl within Close range.
- **Reinforcements — Action:** Summon three additional Nstyl Runners (Lackeys), who appear at Far range. *(Flavour: Azor whistles and more duped Nstyl kids emerge from the dark.)*
- **Coup de Grace — Action: Spend a Fear** to make an attack against a Vulnerable target within Close range. On a success, deal **2d6+12** physical damage and the target must mark a Stress. *(Flavour: Azor steps out of the shadows to strike when someone's down.)*
- **Slippery — Reaction:** When Azor takes damage, he can **mark a Stress** to disengage and move to Far range. *(Flavour: He's a runner, not a fighter.)*

> **GM Note:** Azor only enters combat if forced. Ideally, he's at Far range coordinating while Tus and Zyykl do the work. If both Lackey groups are defeated, Azor may try to flee — this creates a moral choice (chase the mastermind or tend to the wounded Nstyl boys?).

#### Tus & Zyykl — Reskinned Jagged Knife Lackey *(×2 groups)*

> *Tier 1 Minion — Nstyl Bruisers*

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Difficulty** | 9 |
| **Thresholds** | None |
| **HP** | 1 |
| **Stress** | 1 |
| **ATK** | −2 |
| **Weapon** | Melee | 2 phy |
| **Experience** | Grappling +2 |

**Features:**
- **Minion (3) — Passive:** Defeated when they take any damage. For every 3 damage a PC deals to a Lackey, defeat an additional Minion within range.
- **Group Attack — Action: Spend a Fear** to choose a target and spotlight all Lackey units within Close range. Those Minions move into Melee range and make one shared attack roll. On a success, they each deal 2 physical damage. Combine this damage. *(Flavour: They coordinate through hand signals — fast, silent, eerie.)*

> **GM Note:** Tus and Zyykl each lead a group of 3 minions. They fight with brute force and sign-language coordination. They're scary because of their silence — no battle cries, no taunts, just hand signals and sudden violence. A PC who watches carefully can read their signals with an **Instinct** roll.

---

### Scene Flow

1. **The Walk Home** — PCs leave the Celestial Lounge, tired, maybe laughing about Val's antics. Describe the campus growing quiet and dark.
2. **Something's Wrong** — Perception or Instinct check. Shadows moving wrong. Silence that's *too* silent. *(The Nstyl boys are naturally silent — they don't make noise.)*
3. **The Ambush** — Tus and Zyykl strike from the dark. No warning, no demands, no speech — just sign-language coordination and violence.
4. **The Fight** — Standard Daggerheart combat with the stat blocks above. The sign-language-only communication is disorienting for the PCs.
5. **Resolution** — When defeated/subdued, the PCs can try to communicate with the Nstyl fighters. If anyone knows sign language or uses creative solutions, they might learn about Azor and the Prism Falls water.
6. **Aftermath** — Questions left hanging: Who is Azor? Why did the Prism Falls water "lie"? (It didn't — it reveals *true nature*, and maybe these boys *do* have what it takes. The Loom just doesn't agree.)

### Post-Combat

- **If PCs try to communicate:** Tus and Zyykl seem confused and ashamed once the fight drains out of them. They may be willing to sign their story — *"The water said we were real. The man said the paper would prove it."* — but only if someone can understand them.
- **If PCs report to authorities:** Academy staff take it seriously but may not act quickly. Bureaucracy. Plus, failed-out students attacking current ones is embarrassing for the Academy.
- **If PCs investigate on their own:** Seeds for a future subplot involving Azor and whatever he's really after.
- **If PCs helped Tus & Zyykl:** This could pay off later — the Nstyl brothers remember kindness. There's a possible ally thread here.

---

## Phase 3: The Morning After

### Scene: Post-Ambush → Bed

After the ambush, the party stumbles back to the dorms. They're battered, confused, maybe carrying an unconscious Nstyl fighter. The campus is dead quiet.

**GM Pressure Points:**
- It is **extremely late**. Exams start in a few hours.
- Anyone who tries to investigate Azer tonight instead of sleeping should be warned: *"You can chase this now, or you can sleep. But the exam doesn't care about your night."*
- If they report the ambush to campus security, the response is slow and bureaucratic — forms to fill, statements to give. Time bleeds away.

**Transition:** Handwave the rest of the night. *"You collapse into your bunks. Your head barely hits the pillow before—"*

---

### Scene: Morning — The Wake-Up Call

> **BULLHORN:** *"ATTENTION ALL FIRST-YEAR CANDIDATES. REPORT TO THE MAIN COURTYARD AT 0800 HOURS FOR TRACK ASSIGNMENT. THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. STRAGGLERS WILL BE MARKED."*

**Mood:** Harsh morning light. Sore muscles. Not enough sleep. The glamour of the Celestial Lounge feels like a different lifetime. The bruises from the ambush are real.

**Quick Beats:**
- PCs wake up, possibly with Stress still marked from the ambush or sleep deprivation
- Breakfast is "Nutri-Paste" (bland, efficient) unless they make it to Captain's Table (real food, for high ranks)
- Other students are buzzing about the exams — nobody knows about the ambush
- Any NPC who spots their bruises will ask questions

---

### Scene: Track Assignment

This is the in-fiction moment where the PCs choose their **Daggerheart class/subclass**, framed as the Academy assigning them to a specialized training track based on their trial performance and personal aptitude.

**Setting:** The Main Courtyard. Rows of brass terminals. Faculty stationed at department tables. [[Dean Isolde Vane]] presiding from a floating podium (as in the Gen-Ed exam from S2).

**How it works:**
1. Students approach a terminal and receive their **recommended track** based on trial scores
2. They can **accept** the recommendation or **petition** for a different track (requires justification)
3. The party already proved themselves in Gen-Ed — they have some flexibility

---

### Academy Tracks

> [!NOTE]
> These tracks are suggestions designed to map Daggerheart classes to the Vumbua Academy fiction. Adjust names and flavour as needed.

| Academy Track | Daggerheart Archetype | Description | Department Head |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pathfinder Corps** | Ranger / Scout | Navigation, cartography, survival. The front line of exploration. | Senior Exploranaut [[hesperus\|Hesperus]] |
| **Harmonics Division** | Wizard / Sorcerer | Ether resonance, battery science, amplitude manipulation. The "magic" track. | [[professor-kante\|Professor Kante]] |
| **Ironworks Guild** | Guardian / Warrior | Combat, engineering, heavy machinery. Walkers, weapons, walls. | TBD |
| **Verdant Studies** | Druid / Seraph | Ecology, xenobiology, integration science. Working with living systems. | TBD |
| **Shadow Operations** | Rogue / Bard | Intelligence, diplomacy, infiltration. The "soft power" track. | TBD |
| **Medicae Corps** | Healer / Support | Field medicine, stress management, morale. Keeping teams alive. | TBD |

**Key Questions for Each PC:**

| PC | Likely Track | Why | Tension |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[[Ignatius]]** | Ironworks or Pathfinder | Fire-based combat, physical presence | Does he want to fight, or does he want to explore and prove Ash-Blood value? |
| **[[Iggy]]** | Harmonics | Already mentored by Kante, technical genius | Will Kante pull strings to get him? Does Iggy even understand what he's signing up for? |
| **[[Britt]]** | Verdant Studies or Pathfinder | Mizizi connection to living systems | Tension between studying *what she is* vs. blazing her own trail |
| **[[Aggie]]** | Verdant Studies or Shadow Ops | Mizizi ecology knowledge, practical wisdom | She may resist being "studied" — Shadow Ops lets her be an agent, not a specimen |
| **[[Lomi]]** | Ironworks | Boiler-room background, mechanical aptitude | The "worker track" — exactly where Harmony expects him. Does he accept or rebel? |

---

### Player Engagement

- **Let players discuss in-character** — this is a big life decision for their characters. Don't rush it.
- **NPCs weigh in** — Valentine might recommend his own track smugly. Ember might comment. Cassius is stressed about it.
- **The tracks create social dynamics** — PCs in the same track will share classes; PCs in different tracks will have separate adventures.
- **The ambush aftermath lingers** — did anyone report it? Are campus authorities asking questions? Does Azer's scheme become relevant here?

> [!WARNING]
> **Pacing check:** Phase 3 could easily absorb an entire session if players want to explore the class selection deeply. Consider whether this is a quick montage or a full scene depending on table energy.

---

## Open TODOs

> [!NOTE]
> Items that need GM decisions or future drafting:

## Phase 4: Montage — The Resonance Race

### Scene: The Resonance Race

> **Full reference:** See [[circuit-run|The Circuit-Run]] for the complete compendium (rules, energy system, node spectrum, craft types, viewing tiers).

The **first Resonance Race of the intake year** is the biggest social event at [[Vumbua Academy]]. The entire campus empties into the **Apex Ring** — a mile-wide basin of simulated wilderness where teams race to strike Spires, siphon node energy, and light the Grand Resonator at the centre.

**Why this year is special:**
- The arena terrain has been **updated for the first time** to include the **Ash-Blood Isles** and the **Mizizi Forest island** — the two newest integrated territories
- The entire student body is seeing simulated versions of these lands for the first time
- **However:** There is no Ash-Blood Spire in the arena. The [[scrivener-guild|Scrivener Guild]] claims the resonance data isn't finalised. This is a sore point — especially for Ash-Blood students like [[Ignatius]]

**How the PCs experience it:**
- As first-years, they're in the **Bleacher-Walls** (stone amphitheaters on the basin rim)
- They can use brass binoculars and act as **Scout-Spotters** — shouting node coordinates to teams below
- The Rim-Tracker trolley passes by periodically — they can hop on to follow the action
- The **Gilded Zephyrs** (luxury airships with magnifying glass floors) float overhead — a visible reminder of Harmony's class structure

**Key Dramatic Moments (GM picks 2-3):**

1. **The Drop:** Rigs are physically slung or dropped from the amphitheater rim. The initial burst of momentum is all they get before they must strike their first Spire. A massive land-ship ("Goliath") nearly crushes a soloist ("Stinger") on the way down.

2. **The Sync:** A team strikes a Leidian node and gains the **Overclock** boon — extreme speed with a "Phase-Dash" teleport. The crowd roars. But the heat stress is visible — the rig's hull glows cherry-red.

3. **The Missing Node:** [[Ignatius]] notices the Ash-Blood Isles terrain is there, but there's no Ash-Blood Spire. If he asks [[professor-kante|Professor Kante]] (or any faculty), the answer is evasive: *"The data isn't finalised."* This connects directly to the [[The Power System|Ash-Blood Anomaly]] — the integration only produced ~20 amps instead of the expected +300 to +800.

4. **The Battery Lesson:** For students who paid attention in class (especially [[Iggy]]), the race is a live demonstration of everything [[professor-kante|Kante]] teaches. Stored connection, not stored energy. The umber crystal gutter creating an artificial dead zone. The relationship between power draw and nodes needed. *This is the exam in practice.*

5. **Marble Wall vs Dancer & Fabian:** The heavy team smashes through a contested area, destroying a smaller rig. The couple in the racing sailboat (lowest power rating in the field) has to surrender when they encounter the Wall. But they were so close — they only needed two more minor nodes.

6. **The Win:** The Grand Resonator lights up. A pillar of light erupts from the centre of the basin. The crowd goes absolutely berserk. The winning team's Harvest-Prong is still crackling with residual resonance as they're hoisted onto shoulders.

**GM Pacing Notes:**
- This is a **montage scene**, not a mechanical encounter
- Run it as a series of vivid descriptions with crowd reactions. 10-15 minutes max.
- Give each PC one moment of reaction or observation — Iggy noticing the missing node, Britt recognising the simulated Mizizi terrain, Lomi sizing up the engineering, etc.
- The race sets up future plot threads: the Ash-Blood data mystery, the connection/energy distinction, the Captains watching from above

### Play-by-Play: The First Vumbua Circuit-Run

**1. The Launch**
The air is heavy with the smell of ozone and hot copper. Twelve teams are slung from the Southern Rim. **[[Shatter Stamper]]** (Team 1) gets a massive launch, their heavy rig slamming down onto the canyon floor with a bone-shaking thud. **[[Pudge]]** (Team 4) takes a more vertical drop, their gyro-boat catching a thermal and gliding over the petrified treetops.

**2. The First Sync**
**[[Shatter Stamper]]** reaches the first Aero-Static spire. Their Harvest-Prong strikes — a massive flash of blue light. The Rig suddenly loses 90% of its weight, allowing it to leap a canyon wall that would have stopped it dead.
Behind them, **[[Marble Wall]]** (Team 3) isn't racing; they're hunting. They ignore the first spires and instead ram into a soloist team, pinning them against the petrified bark. *"Strategy: Destroy first, collect later."*

**3. The Mid-Match Chaos**
The "Loom-Pulse" triggers. New Spires erupt from the ground. A Crystalline node appears right in front of **[[Dancer & Fabian]]** (Team 5). They strike it, their sailboat hull turning into semi-fluid glass. They pass right through a narrow crack in the canyon wall that **[[Shatter Stamper]]** has to go around.
Meanwhile, **[[Pudge]]** is struggling. Their gryphon-hybrid requires massive connection to overcome its handicap. They strike a Vitruvian node, doubling their sync duration, but they're still behind the Global Amplitude line.

**4. The Final Stretch**
Only three teams left in contention for the Grand Resonator. **[[Marble Wall]]** is bearing down on **[[Dancer & Fabian]]**. Fabian is at the rudder, Dancer is on the Harvest-Prong. They hit a Kinetic-Echo spire, leaving a hard-light trail. As **[[Marble Wall]]** prepares to ram, **[[Dancer & Fabian]]** perform an instant U-turn on their own trail, letting the heavy rig sail past into a canyon wall.

**5. The Grand Resonator**
**[[Pudge]]** finally hits the needed amplitude. The gyro-boat’s battery glows brilliant purple. With a final Aero-Static jump, they soar over the crowd, landing directly in front of the Grand Resonator.
**Strike!** The discharge creates a blinding pillar of light that illuminates the entire basin. **[[Pudge]] wins!**
The crowd erupts. Valerius is shouting over the radio. The Captains in the Zephyrs are leaning over their magnifying floors, marking their tally sheets.

### Scene: Finding Rill

**The Setup:** The PCs need to find [[Rill]] — she invited [[Britt]] and [[Aggie]] to visit her at the grass-covered building near [[Block 99]] back in Session 2. But when they arrive, she's not there. She's busy prepping for the opening Resonance Race.

**Finding her requires effort:**
- Her usual spot (the grass-covered building inset into the hill) is **empty**. Bark samples are scattered on the desk, half-finished notes, a cold cup of something fungal.
- If PCs ask around: *"Rill? She's been running between the Basin and the Fungal Labs all morning. Something about calibrations."*
- If PCs check the Fungal Labs: She's there with **[[Professor Ink]]** — the [[scrivener-guild|Scrivener Guild]] Captain and fungal biology specialist. They're hunched over what looks like living moss samples, arguing about "resonance frequencies in petrified bark."

**The Encounter:**

When the PCs finally track her down, Rill is distracted, stressed, and clearly conflicted. She's happy to see [[Britt]] and [[Aggie]] — but there's guilt behind the smile.

**What Rill reveals (if pushed):**

1. **The Journey:** She and [[Professor Ink]] are planning an expedition **back into the [[Mizizi Petrified Forest]]**. Ink wants to study the trees — specifically what they *remember*. Rill wants to find a cure for the "Eternal Growth" corruption affecting the [[Mizizi]].

2. **Her Shame:** Rill left the Forest two years ago. The [[Mizizi]] see her as a **traitor**. She didn't just leave — she was the first to walk out. To go *back*, escorted by a Harmony academic... that's going to feel like an invasion to the Elders.

   > *"I know what they'll say. 'She left, and now she brings outsiders.' But Ink can see things in the bark that I can't. The trees are dying, Britt. Slowly. And the Elders won't let anyone help because they think stagnation IS health."*

3. **Her Secret (GM discretion):** Rill is secretly [[Wadi]], not [[Mizizi]]. Her River Clan heritage gives her a different perspective on "Flow" vs "Stagnation" — it's why she can solve problems true Mizizi cannot. She won't reveal this unless deeply trusted.

4. **The Danger:** The heart of the [[Mizizi Petrified Forest]] is **protected**. The deeper you go, the more dangerous it gets:
   - **Hallucinations** — the forest's defence mechanism. The petrified trees project visions that confuse intruders
   - **Beasts** — creatures adapted to live in the hallucinogenic environment, potentially immune to the confusion
   - **The Elders** — the Mizizi leadership doesn't welcome visitors. They may view Rill's return as a threat

**Emotional Stakes:**
- For **Britt/Aggie**: Rill is the only other Mizizi they know at the Academy. She's asking them to understand why she left — and maybe to support her return.
- For **other PCs**: This is a window into Mizizi culture, the Petrified Forest's dangers, and a future quest hook.
- For **Rill**: She's torn between her excitement about the journey and her terror of what she'll face when she gets there. She's also trying to manage Zephyr, prep the Resonance Race, and assist the Dean — she's stretched thin.

**Professor Ink — Quick Reference:**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | [[scrivener-guild|Scrivener Guild]] Captain |
| **Specialty** | Fungal biology, petrified bark analysis |
| **Personality** | Pure thirst for knowledge. Academic to the bone. Loves [[Iggy]]'s curiosity but is genuinely afraid [[Ignatius]] will burn his specimens. |
| **Motivation** | The trees of the [[Mizizi Petrified Forest]] may be the oldest living records in Harmony. If they're *remembering* something, Ink wants to know what. |
| **Relationship to Rill** | Research partners. He provides the scientific rigour; she provides the cultural context and access. |

**GM Notes:**
- This scene should feel **quiet and personal** — a contrast to the party and the ambush. It's a conversation, not an encounter.
- Don't force Rill to reveal everything. Let the PCs earn her trust through roleplay.
- If a PC offers to help with the forest expedition, that's a **major future quest hook** — flag it.
- If [[Iggy]] is present, Professor Ink will light up. There's a natural bond there.

## Phase 5: The Exam

### Scene: The Written Exam

**The Venue — The Basin:**

The Resonance Race basin doubles as the largest classroom in Harmony. A **mile-wide** open-air stadium, with terminals set up along the upper tiers. The remaining **~70,000 students** file in and take their seats at individual testing stations.

The scale is staggering. The Basin can hold far more than 70k — it was built for the Race, and the exam is just borrowing the space. Students sit in long stretches around the upper rim, each with a terminal. The basin floor far below is empty — for now.

**The Exam Format:**
- Terminal-based written exam
- Multiple-choice and short-answer using [[The Loom]]-connected terminals
- Questions cover the first week of general education: resonance theory, node science, navigation basics, survival protocol
- **~20,000 students will fail** and be sent home

> [!NOTE]
> **TODO:** Create Lucky's test questions — 10 questions with Val's annotated answers. This is the comedic/practical prep from Phase 1 paying off.

**GM Pressure Points:**
- The PCs should feel the weight of 70,000 people taking the same exam
- If they studied (or got Val's cheat sheet, or talked to Rill about Weeping Nodes), they have advantages
- The exam itself should be **quick in real-time** — don't simulate every question. Hit 2-3 key moments with dice rolls, then move to results

---

### Scene: The Drop

**The spectacle of failure.**

The **20,000 students who failed** get one consolation: they're allowed to **drop into the Basin** — the only way to set foot on the storied basin floor. They walk to the rim, step off, and slide/drop down the concave walls to the basin floor below.

From there, they walk out through the front gate and straight to port. Ships are waiting. It's the most dignified exit the Academy can offer — you failed, but you got to touch the floor that legends race on.

**For the PCs:**
- This is **cinematic**. Describe 20,000 people slowly walking to the edge and dropping in. Some are crying. Some are laughing. Some are determined to come back.
- The PCs *passed*. They're watching this from the upper tiers. It should feel heavy.

**For the PCs who passed:**
- They're told they can descend into the Basin too, if they want — to get a head start on exploring the space where they'll eventually need to impress the Captains.
- This is optional. Some students sprint down. Others linger, watching the failed candidates walk to port.

---

### Scene: Team Assignment & The Loom

**The Loom speaks.**

After the exam, the remaining **~50,000 students** receive their team assignments. The [[The Loom|Loom]] — the ancient engine in the [[Walker-Core]] that powers the Academy's systems — assigns each student to a squad.

**How it works:**
- Each student approaches a Loom terminal (or the assignment appears on their existing exam screen)
- The Loom delivers a **one-liner** — a short, cryptic statement that serves as both assignment and prophecy
- Students with matching one-liners are on the same team

**Example Loom one-liners** (for the PC squad):
- *"The fire that doesn't burn feeds the root that doesn't grow."* → Ignatius + Britt?
- *"What sinks in still water rises in the current."* → Aggie + Iggy?
- *"The hammer asks the mountain: who shaped whom?"* → Lomi?

> [!NOTE]
> **GM Decision:** Craft the actual Loom one-liners for each PC. These should feel like fortune-cookie-meets-prophecy — short, poetic, and thematically tied to the character's arc.

**What happens next:**
- Students are told they can now **prepare to see the Captains**
- A rest week follows, during which teams interview with available Captains for their first **venture journey** — a one-month trial expedition
- The best Captains take the highest-ranked candidates. Your team's initial ranking determines your options
- Each PC's clan suggested a Captain in the first survey — that's their "recommended" match

**GM Notes:**
- The team assignment should feel **momentous** — this is the party officially forming
- The Loom is ancient and somewhat mysterious. Its one-liners are never wrong, but they're often only understood in retrospect
- Leave the Captain interviews for Session 4 — this session ends on the team forming
