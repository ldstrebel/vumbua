# Scene 1: The Bonfire (Block 99)

**Setting:** Night. The industrial sector around Block 99 (Copper/Worker dorms). A geothermal plant with steam stacks forms the backdrop. The "Bonfire" is a burning pile of construction scraps in a pit---the students managed the airflow but couldn't light it until [[ignatius|Ignatius]] arrived. Far above, the lights of the Sky-Spire shimmer where the Gold-tier galas are held. Down here, the air smells of smoke, engine grease, and possibility.

**Arrived via:** [[serra-vox|Serra Vox]]'s invitation at the crane (end of Session 1).

**Time Pressure:** Tomorrow at 8:00 AM is the first class: **Gen-Ed Exploration 101**. Players can stay as long as they want, but sleep deprivation could have consequences.

## The Scene

The bonfire roars thanks to Ignatius's True Flame---the first real fire most Harmony students have ever seen. It casts dancing orange shadows instead of the steady teal glow of Safe-Flame. Students are drawn to it like moths. The party is at the center of attention whether they want to be or not.

**Opening Beat:** Serra Vox is hovering near the party, nervously trying to play host. She keeps introducing the PCs to people, calling them "my friends from the Island." Britt's hostility and Ignatius's distrust make this increasingly awkward.

**Ambient Details:**
- ~40 students milling around, mostly Copper and Silver rank
- A few Gold-rank students observing from a distance, clearly slumming
- Steam vents hiss periodically, momentarily drowning out conversation
- Someone rigged a crude speaker playing scratchy music from a crystal
- The bonfire pit has been dug with mathematical precision (optimal airflow, as Cassius described)
- Lomi's Block 99 dorm is visible behind the gathering---he's essentially hosting

## NPC Interactions

### Serra Vox
*The Eager Ally (Gold / Bard / Squad 01)*

Serra is still buzzing from meeting the party at the crane. She's planted herself near the group, notebook in hand, asking too many questions with too much enthusiasm.

**Opening:**
> "So I was thinking---and please tell me if this is weird---but what if we formed a study group? I mean, not a *formal* one, obviously. I just think it would be really, really fascinating to compare notes. You know, cross-cultural academic synergy?"

**If players are receptive:**
> "Can I ask you something? The fire---[[ignatius|Ignatius]]'s fire---it's *different*, right? It's not Safe-Flame. I've been studying Harmonic Theory for six years and I've never seen anything resonate like that. The frequency is all wrong. It should be chaotic but it's... beautiful?"

**If players are hostile (likely from [[britt|Britt]]/[[ignatius|Ignatius]]):**
> (Deflating) "I'm sorry. I know I'm being a lot. I just... nobody at the Spire parties actually *talks* about anything real. They just compare receipts. You're the first people who seem like you're actually *here* for something."

> [!TIP]
> **Gain Insight: Harmonic Theory**
> Serra knows the difference between Geometric (Harmony) and Variance (Wild) magic. She's noticed Ignatius's fire doesn't follow Harmony's frequency patterns. This is the first hint that Wild Magic operates on different physics.

**GM Notes:**
- Serra is genuinely kind but socially clumsy. She is from House Vox (Gold-tier nobility) but is hiding that from the party. She's assigned to Squad 01 (The Echelon) with [[valerius-sterling|Valerius Sterling]], who she privately dislikes.
- If [[britt|Britt]] pushes hard on "what's your deal?", Serra will nervously deflect but drop breadcrumbs: she mentions "the gala" at the Spire (implying she was invited but chose to come here instead).
- Her notebook contains surprisingly accurate sketches of Ash-Blood fire patterns. She's been observing Ignatius since the intake.

### Cassius Thorne
*The Nervous Student (Gold / Paladin / Squad 01)*

A well-dressed boy in a slightly rumpled Academy uniform, crouching behind the bonfire pit's stone edge. He's clearly not supposed to be here---his family is at the Arch-Duke's gala in the Sky-Spire.

**Opening:**
> (Jumping when approached) "Shh! I'm not supposed to be here. My family is at the Arch-Duke's gala, but... I needed to study. Did you know the manual actually recommends a Synchronized Helix for the Z-Axis Paradox? Everyone else just brute-forces it."

**If players study with him:**
> "The Gen-Ed exam tomorrow isn't what you think. It's not written. It's a field exercise. Professor [[hesperus|Hesperus]] takes you outside the perimeter. Like, *actually* outside. Past the construction zone. My brother told me---he said the first ten minutes are fine, and then the fog rolls in."

**If players ask about his family:**
> (Uncomfortable) "My family is... Thorne. As in, the Thornes. Captain Elara Thorne is my... it doesn't matter. I'm just tired of being 'a Thorne.' I want to earn something myself."

> [!TIP]
> **Gain Insight: Cartography**
> The "Dead-Stick Drop" is a myth. The manual says **Synchronized Helix** if you want to pass the Z-Axis Paradox in tomorrow's exam.

> [!TIP]
> **Gain Insight: The Gen-Ed Exam**
> It's a field exercise, not a written test. Professor [[hesperus|Hesperus]] takes students outside the perimeter. Fog is involved. Cassius's brother warned him about the first ten minutes.

**GM Notes:**
- Cassius is Cassius **Thorne**---son of Captain Elara Thorne, the exploranaut who first contacted the [[ash-bloods|Ash-Bloods]] and escorted [[lady-ignis|Lady Ignis]] to Harmony Seat. He's Squad 01 but hates the pressure of his family name.
- He is genuinely nice and could become a real ally if the party treats him well.
- His "brother" is an older Thorne who graduated two years ago and is currently stationed at the Ash-Blood Integration Site.

### Lucky
*The Hustler (Rust / Rogue / Squad 09)*

[[lucky|Lucky]] is working the crowd with a bag of dubiously-acquired goods. He's already wearing a different hat than when the party last saw him (he traded [[iggy|Iggy]]'s trumpet for something better). He recognizes Iggy immediately.

**Opening:**
> "Hey! Bug-Eyes! You owe me---that trumpet thing you gave me? It works. Too well. Blew it in the barracks and three guys went deaf for an hour. I love it." (Grinning) "So, what do you need tonight? Maps? Answers? Or the truth about the Void-Lily?"

**If players ask about maps:**
> "I got a partial layout of the campus---the *real* one, not the tourist version. Shows the maintenance tunnels under the Deep-Hull. Cost you... something interesting. I don't take receipts."

**If players ask about the Void-Lily:**
> "There's this flower that grows in the scrap heaps near the perimeter. Harmony says it's a pest---kill on sight. But the old crews? They say if you leave it alone, the Void-Beasts won't come near you. Something about the smell. I saw one up close once. Prettiest thing I've ever seen, right before I almost died."

**If players ask about the exam:**
> "The exam's outside the fence, yeah? Word is, Hesperus lost a student last year. Like, *lost* lost. Kid walked into the fog and just... poof. They say the fog has a voice."

> [!TIP]
> **Gain Insight: Xenobiology**
> The Void-Lily supports the ecosystem. Sometimes you gotta **lie to the suits (Environmental Masking)** to save the forest.

> [!TIP]
> **Gain Insight: First Contact**
> If you act like a soldier, they'll act like a warrior. **Be vulnerable (Vulnerability)**.

> [!TIP]
> **Gain Insight: Campus Layout**
> [[lucky|Lucky]] has a partial map of the maintenance tunnels under the Deep-Hull. He'll trade it for "something interesting"---not receipts, not money. Something *weird*.

**GM Notes:**
- Lucky is Rust-rank (Squad 09 / The Ablative---trap detection duty). He survived by being fast and useful.
- He already traded with [[iggy|Iggy]] in Session 1. He views Iggy as a fellow outsider and potential business partner.
- The Broker Silas ([[syndicate-of-sails|Syndicate of Sails]]) is already trying to recruit Lucky as an informant. If players befriend Lucky, they may accidentally get on the Syndicate's radar.
- Lucky's "maps" are real but incomplete. The maintenance tunnels connect to the Walker-Core---and the Loom.

---

### Sarge
*The Veteran (Copper / Warrior / Squad 09)*

[[sarge|Sarge]] is sitting on an overturned crate near the steam vents, nursing a flask of something that smells like engine coolant. He recognizes [[lomi|Lomi]] from the workers' campfires before the Academy existed.

**Opening:**
> (To [[lomi|Lomi]] specifically) "Loaves! You made it past Day One. That's more than I can say for about ten thousand of those poor bastards." (Takes a drink) "You kids worry too much about the test. You should worry about what's left of you when the mist takes your legs."

**If players ask about the mist:**
> "I worked perimeter detail during construction. Before they put up the fences. There's things out there---in the fog, past where the lights reach. Not animals. Animals run. These things *wait*. They wait until you're scared, and then they come."

**If players ask about his Squad (09):**
> (Bitter laugh) "Squad 09. 'The Ablative.' You know what ablative means? It means the part of the shield that burns off first to protect the rest. That's us. We go in first, and whatever happens to us tells the Silvers and Golds whether it's safe."

**If Lomi asks about the engines:**
> "Something's wrong with the boilers, Loaves. I can feel it. The hum's off. Used to be steady---now it stutters. Like a heartbeat skipping. I asked the foreman; he said 'upgrades.' But I've been around engines my whole life. That ain't upgrades. That's something *dying*."

> [!TIP]
> **Gain Insight: Anchor of Self**
> It's not about magic. Hold onto your **Flaw**---it's the only thing that's real when the fog tries to take your identity.

> [!TIP]
> **Gain Insight: Crisis Management**
> Food is a luxury. Power is life. **Patch the Engine.** Always patch the engine first.

> [!TIP]
> **Gain Insight: The Boiler Problem** *(Lomi only)*
> The engines are stuttering. The official line is "upgrades," but [[sarge|Sarge]]---who has worked engines his whole life---says something is dying. This is the first breadcrumb toward [[the-minimum|The Minimum]].

**GM Notes:**
- Sarge is Lomi's strongest existing relationship at the Academy. They bonded over campfires during the construction phase, before the intake.
- His insight about the boilers is the first PC-accessible clue about [[the-minimum|The Minimum]]. If Lomi investigates, he can find the cracking containment seals.
- Sarge's Squad 09 assignment is effectively a death sentence. He knows it. He's drinking because he's already said goodbye.

---

### Nyx
*The Shadow (Silver / Rogue / Squad 03 "The Silence")*

[[nyx|Nyx]] is barely visible at the edge of the firelight. She's a Whisper-Elf with ash-grey skin who looks like she's part of the smoke. She doesn't approach anyone---but she watches everything. If a player specifically seeks her out, she speaks in a near-whisper.

**Opening:**
> (Not looking at the player) "You're loud. All of you. The fire is loud. The laughter is loud. Do you know what happens when you're loud near a Node?" (Pause) "It weeps."

**If players ask about Nodes:**
> "They yell orders at the Nodes. 'Produce! Stabilize! Integrate!' But if a Node is weeping... you cannot cure sadness with a hammer. You must listen. You must match its frequency. You must cry with it before it will trust you."

**If players ask about her squad:**
> "Squad 03. We go where the silence is thickest. We find the things that don't want to be found." (Long pause) "I volunteered."

**If Iggy approaches (important):**
> ([[nyx|Nyx]] studies Iggy for an uncomfortable amount of time) "You smell like deep water. And stone. Where did you say you were from?"

> [!TIP]
> **Gain Insight: Resonance**
> You can't cure sadness with a hammer. You have to cry with it. **(Sympathetic Dissonance/Match Frequency)** --- this is the key to the [[mizizi|Mizizi]] integration puzzle.

**GM Notes:**
- Nyx is the most dangerous NPC at this bonfire. She is perceptive enough to notice something is off about Iggy. Her question about "deep water and stone" is the first time anyone has questioned Iggy's cover story.
- If Iggy deflects well, Nyx will back off but remain suspicious. If Iggy fumbles, Nyx won't report him---but she'll start watching him closely.
- Her insight about "matching frequency" with weeping Nodes is the single most important mechanical clue in the bonfire scene. It is the answer to the [[mizizi|Mizizi]] Integration puzzle: you don't force knowledge into the forest---you grieve with it.

---

### Kojo
*The Help Desk (Silver / Mizizi / Faculty-Adjacent)*

[[kojo|Kojo]] is a Mizizi Silver-rank student who has been at the Academy for over a year. He's physically similar to Britt and [[aggie|Aggie]]---a fungal-turtle hybrid---but his coloring is different: deep amber with golden spots. He's tending the bonfire, adding carefully selected scraps to maintain the burn.

**Opening (to Britt and [[aggie|Aggie]] specifically):**
> (In Mizizi, then switching to Common) "Cousins! I heard we had new roots arriving. Welcome to the Sterile Field." (Gestures at the Academy) "Don't worry---you get used to the lack of rot. Eventually."

**If Britt/Aggie ask about the Academy:**
> "The Harmony students are... kind. In the way that people are kind to a pet. They admire the shell, they ask about the spores, but they don't understand that we are the scroll *and* the ink." (Beat) "We are not just roots. Remember that."

**If they ask about [[rill|Rill]]:**
> "[[rill|Rill]]? She's been here longer than me. She came from the forest, but she's... different now. Cleaner. Faster. She works directly with the Dean. I barely see her anymore." (Carefully) "She's been asking questions about the trees. Not the usual questions. Deeper ones. About what the trees *remember*."

**If they ask about the forest:**
> "They want to burn it. [[verdant-trust|The Verdant Trust]]---the food people from the capital---they want to mulch every tree and ship the soil home. They say Harmony Prime's farms are dying." (Drops voice) "But Exploranaut Mosi is fighting them. He says the trees aren't just wood. He says they're... libraries."

> [!TIP]
> **Gain Insight: The Mizizi Crisis**
> The [[The Verdant Trust|Verdant Trust]] wants to mulch the Petrified Forest for fertilizer. Exploranaut Mosi believes the trees are "libraries." Rill is asking deep questions about what the trees remember.

> [!TIP]
> **Gain Insight: Rill's Research**
> Rill has been at the Academy for over a year and works directly with the Dean. She's changed---cleaner, faster, more serious. She's researching what the Petrified Forest trees *remember*.

**GM Notes:**
- [[kojo|Kojo]] is the party's best Mizizi contact at the Academy. He's the bridge between the newcomers (Britt/Aggie) and the Academy's Mizizi community.
- His line about "the scroll and the ink" is his way of processing the Shattered Empire revelation---that the Mizizi aren't gardeners but Archivists.
- His mention of Mosi fighting the [[The Verdant Trust|Verdant Trust]] sets up a faction conflict the party can get involved in.

### The Bonfire
*The Fire Itself*

The bonfire is burning Ignatius's True Flame---Variance (Wild) magic, not Harmony's Safe-Flame. It's behaving strangely.

**What everyone notices:**
- The fire is orange and red, not teal. It casts *shadows*---real, dancing shadows. Safe-Flame doesn't cast shadows.
- The heat is different. It's not regulated. Some gusts are scorching; some are gentle. The fire is *alive*.

**What Ignatius notices (Ash-Blood perception):**
> The fire is... hungry. It's eating the construction scraps, but it's reaching for something else. The flames lean toward Iggy, then toward the Mizizi students, then back to you. It's tasting the air around each clan member. You've never seen fire do this before.

**What Iggy notices ([[trench-kin|Trench-Kin]] perception):**
> The ground under the bonfire pit is vibrating. Not from the heat---from something deeper. You can feel it through your feet like a low hum. It's the same frequency as the pressure waves back home. Something underground is... responding to the fire.

**What Britt/Aggie notice (Mizizi perception):**
> The smoke from the fire is drifting in an unusual pattern. It's not rising straight up---it's curling toward the treeline where the Petrified Forest begins. Like the forest is... inhaling.

> [!TIP]
> **Gain Insight: The Resonance**
> The True Flame is interacting with clan members differently. Fire, Earth, and Forest are responding to each other's proximity. This is the first observable evidence of the Shattered Circuit---the Nodes "reaching" for each other through their representatives.

**GM Notes:**
- This is the single most important moment of the bonfire. The fire's behavior is the first physical evidence of the Shattered Circuit theory. Three clan members (Ash-Blood, [[trench-kin|Trench-Kin]], Mizizi) are in proximity for the first time, and their Nodes are resonating through them.
- Do NOT explain this to the players. Let them describe what they're seeing and feeling. If they connect the dots, it's a eureka moment. If they don't, it becomes a mystery to revisit later.
- If Ignatius tries to control the fire, it resists---but gently. It wants to reach the others.

## Exploration Options

### Wander Away
*The Industrial Zone at Night*

If a player (likely [[iggy|Iggy]]) decides to wander away from the bonfire:

**The Construction Zone:** Cranes stand still like sleeping giants. Worker-Constructs are in low-power mode, occasionally twitching. The half-built campus stretches into darkness.

**The Perimeter Fence:** A chain-link barrier with teal-glowing ley-lines woven through it. Beyond it: darkness, and occasionally, movement. Something large shifts in the fog.

**The Steam Tunnels (if [[iggy|Iggy]] investigates Block 99):** A network of maintenance tunnels running under the geothermal plant. The air is warm and pressurized---comfortable for someone used to deep-earth living. The tunnels connect to the Walker-Core. Iggy can hear the Loom humming from below.

> [!TIP]
> **Gain Insight: Campus Layout (Iggy)**
> The steam tunnels under Block 99 connect to the Walker-Core. The air pressure increases as you go deeper---almost like home. The Loom's hum is audible from below.

---

### Go to Bed
*Skip the Scene*

If a player goes to bed early, they get a full night's rest (mechanical benefit for tomorrow's exam). But they dream:

- **[[ignatius|Ignatius]] dreams:** His volcano, roaring. But the lava is flowing *toward* something, not erupting outward. It's reaching.
- **Iggy dreams:** The pressure of home. But for the first time, the darkness isn't comforting. Something is pushing *back* from below.
- **[[britt|Britt]]/[[aggie|Aggie]] dream:** The Petrified Forest. The trees are humming. Not the usual creaking---humming. Like they're trying to sing a song they've forgotten.
- **[[lomi|Lomi]] dreams:** The boiler room. The gauges are all red. A voice says: "Patch the engine. Patch the engine. Patch the engine." When he reaches for the wrench, his hand passes through it.

---

## Scene Transitions

**If players stay late:** They see the Gold-tier students leaving the Sky-Spire gala. One of them---[[valerius-sterling|Valerius Sterling]]---pauses at the railing and looks down at the bonfire with visible contempt. Serra notices and goes quiet.

**If players leave together:** Walking back to their dorms, they pass the Clan Assistance Office. The lights are on. Inside, [[rill|Rill]] is alone at a desk, surrounded by stacks of bark samples. She doesn't notice them.

**Morning After:** Regardless of choices, all players wake to a bullhorn announcement: *"GEN-ED EXPLORATION 101. COURTYARD. 0800. DO NOT BE LATE. PROFESSOR HESPERUS DOES NOT WAIT."*
