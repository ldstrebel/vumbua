# Session 2.5 Planning - The Power Room

## Scene: Iggy Sneaks Into the Power Room

### Setup

[[iggy|Iggy]] has slipped away from the group to explore the Academy's power room on his own. This scene is a deep-dive into the energy infrastructure of Harmony, and sets up the central mystery of the Ash-Blood Anomaly.

### Location: The Power Room

Located in the Walker-Core, the power room houses the resonators, pressure gauges, and energy routing systems that keep Vumbua running. It's an industrial space---humming machinery, hissing pipes, printed chart rolls tracking energy output.

## NPCs Present

### Tommy (Front Desk)
- **Race:** Gnome
- **Role:** Clerk / gatekeeper
- **Personality:** Chipper, eager, not suspicious at all
- **Key Detail:** Wants to apply to Vumbua Academy next year
- **Interaction:** Easy to persuade that Iggy has business here or is there for a class. Waves him through without much fuss. Doesn't really do anything meaningful.

### Lucina (Maintenance)
- **Race:** Dwarf
- **Role:** Routine maintenance worker
- **Philosophy:** "Why go through the effort to travel when you can get it for free by working?"
- **Key Detail:** Chose maintenance over the explorer track deliberately. Content with steady work.
- **Interaction:** Background NPC. May comment on the absurdity of risking your life as an explorer.

### Marla (Maintenance)
- **Race:** Human
- **Role:** Routine maintenance worker
- **Backstory:** Failed out of the Academy about two decades ago in a small class (~100 candidates). Only one person made Exploranaut that year: **Elara Thorne** (who later discovered the Ash-Bloods). Marla never got a second chance.
- **Key Detail:** Bitter about the system, feels robbed, thinks it's unfair.
- **Interaction:** If Iggy or conversation prompts it, she'll share her story---providing context about how competitive past classes were and namedroping Elara Thorne.

### Professor Kante (The Discovery)
- **Race:** Tortoise
- **Accent:** Indian, slow-speaking
- **Role:** Professor of Harmonics, key researcher in battery technology
- **Affiliation:** House Gilded (origin), House Vox (research sponsor)
- **Key Detail:** Has been taking measurements every night. Will have been watching Iggy without Iggy noticing.
- **Entrance:** Appears after Iggy has dug deep into the historical records. Does not announce himself---Iggy simply realizes he's being watched.

## What Iggy Discovers (Progressive Exploration)

### Stage 1: Initial Observations
- The power room has a **high degree of surge protection**---more engineering than seems necessary for the amount of power being pulled through
- The setup feels **extremely over-engineered** at the macro level

### Stage 2: Crystal Examination
- If [[iggy|Iggy]] pulls out a crystal and takes it apart, he finds a **similar pattern at the atomic scale**
- The crystal's internal structure is designed for consistent flow and managing surges
- He's positive he **can't replicate it**, but recognizes the design philosophy matches the room-scale engineering
- Both the room and the crystals share the same principle: over-engineered for consistency

### Stage 3: Pressure Gauges and Charts
- The printed charts show that the **energy max is just barely above the current output level**
- Only a **small amount of energy is being rerouted**---the system is running very close to its limit
- This contradicts the over-engineering: why build so much surge protection if there's barely any energy to surge?

### Stage 4: Historical Records
- Digging into archived records, [[iggy|Iggy]] finds documentation of the **[[The Power System|Global Amplitude]]**
- It's a measurement of total ether energy across Harmony's integrated territory
- The historical trend shows a **gradually increasing line** over all of recorded history---as nodes were integrated, the amplitude grew
- **Critical finding:** In the last 80 years, the line has **plateaued** and then started to **decline** for the first time ever

### Stage 5: Professor Kante Appears
- While Iggy is deep in the records, he won't notice that **[[professor-kante|Professor Kante]]** has been watching him
- Kante reveals himself and is intrigued by Iggy's curiosity and technical understanding
- He invites Iggy to see his whiteboard

---

## Professor Kante's Whiteboard

The whiteboard is covered in measurements, projections, and unanswered questions:

### Data Points
- [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] max line comparison: 50 years ago vs. 100 years ago (showing the plateau)
- Current resonance max: **~600 amps**
- Panda line battery setting: **550 amps**

### Question 1: "Where Is the Ash-Blood Surge?"
- Projections showed the Ash-Blood integration should increase [[The Power System|Global Amplitude]] from 600 by **+300, +500, or +800 amps** (based on the clan's size and synergy calculations)
- Actual result: **~20 amp increase**---barely better than a minor node discovered 80 years ago
- This is written next to the scrapped **Apex 1** battery line, which was designed for surge protection above the projected 900-1400 range

### Question 2: "What Happens Below the Storage Line?"
- The entire purpose of Vox batteries (the Panda line) is **consistent power output**
- If the Global Amplitude drops below what the batteries can regulate (~550), the ether field's natural "breathing" (small surges and dips) will overwhelm the surge protection
- Power output becomes **erratic and unpredictable**
- Implication: the infrastructure that keeps Harmony stable becomes the thing that makes it unstable

---

## Kante's Proposition

Kante has two problems he can't solve alone:

1. **The Missing Surge:** Why did a major node integration produce minor node results?
2. **The Apex 1 Crisis:** His next-gen battery line is scrapped. All marketing plans, all House Vox promises to investors---moot.

He wants to work with [[iggy|Iggy]] to investigate. He sees in Iggy a fresh perspective---someone who isn't trapped in Harmony's assumptions about how energy should work.

## GM Notes

### What This Scene Sets Up
- **The Ash-Blood Anomaly** as a central mystery for [[iggy|Iggy]]'s arc
- **[[professor-kante|Professor Kante]]** as a mentor/ally figure
- **The power system** as something players can interact with mechanically, not just narratively
- Foreshadowing of **[[the-minimum|The Minimum]]**---the crisis becomes tangible through numbers, not just rumors
- Connection to the **Shattered Circuit theory**---the Ash-Blood node is bleeding energy to its missing siblings

### Dramatic Irony
- [[iggy|Iggy]] is [[trench-kin|Trench-Kin]]---one of the "missing siblings" the Ash-Blood node is reaching out to
- If Kante knew what Iggy was, the mystery might be half-solved
- Iggy's unique perspective (from a completely different type of node) is exactly what Kante needs

### Tone
- Quiet, investigative, cerebral
- Contrast with the social chaos of the bonfire scenes
- The hum of machinery, the hiss of pressure valves, the scratch of chalk on whiteboard
- A slow-burn revelation, not a dramatic twist
