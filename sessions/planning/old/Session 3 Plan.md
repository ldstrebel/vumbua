# Session 3 Planning

## Goals
- **The Celestial Lounge**: Late-night social encounter before exams—winding down, character moments.
- **The Ambush**: Combat encounter on the way back to dorms.
- **Morning After**: Long rest → first day of class selection.

---

## Phase 1: The Celestial Lounge

### Setting

**Location:** [[celestial-lounge|The Celestial Lounge]] — top floor of the tallest building in the northwest "fancy district" of [[vumbua-academy|Vumbua]] 

**Time:** Very late at night—the party is winding down when the PCs arrive. Most students are tired and heading out. The late hour matters: exams are tomorrow.

There are a couple nameless bouncers at the door. They only check receipts if offered. If you were Gold then you would have been able to skip the 

**Mood:** Warm amber light, soft music fading, empty glasses on tables. The glamour of earlier in the evening is giving way to yawns and goodbyes. A few diehards cling to the night.

---

### Key NPCs

#### [[valentine-sterling|Valentine "Val" Sterling]] — The Host

Val is hosting the gathering and is one of the last people still animated and awake despite the late hour. He feels supremely well-prepared for tomorrow's exams—he even bought one of [[Lucky]]'s test answer packets out of curiosity. He found it to be a decent estimation of the real exam, but wouldn't rely on it alone; he spotted some flaws in the answers.

**What Val wants right now:**
- He's trying to get someone—*anyone*—to play one more round, but everyone is tired and leaving.
- He just wants to make his papa ([[valentine-sterling-sr|Valentine Sterling Sr.]]) proud.

**The Sleeping Cousin:**
Val's cousin, **[[valerius-sterling|Valerius Sterling]]**, came by after finishing his late-night radio broadcast. He challenged Val to a game of Crown & Ruin, lost spectacularly, and is currently passed out on a velvet chaise lounge in one of the side parlors.
- **Valentine's Remark:** If approached, Val casually points a thumb toward the side room with a smirk: *"If you want a real challenge, you could try waking Valerius. He's currently drooling on a silk pillow in the East Parlor. Couldn't handle the dice tonight. Shocking lack of stamina for a man who talks for a living."*

**Val's Test Answers** *(potential RP hook)*:
> [!NOTE]
> See the GM Notes in [[lucky|Lucky]] and [[valentine-sterling|Valentine Sterling]] for details on the test questions and Val's annotations. This could be used as a handout or an RP conversation.

- He offers **two games** — players can pick one or play both.

---

### 🎲 Game 1: "Crown & Ruin" *(Push-Your-Luck Dice Game)*

**What it teaches:** The Hope/Fear dice, Stress accumulation, Hope/Fear token economy.

**The Drink:** A tray of "Void Shots" — a glowing, bitter Academy drink that burns going down. **Every time you mark a Stress in this game, you take a shot in-fiction.** Val pours with a grin.

#### Rules

1. Players take turns rolling the **Hope die and Fear die** (the actual 2d12).
2. **If Hope ≥ Fear:** You bank the difference as points. Earn a **Hope token** (real — you keep this).
3. **If Fear > Hope:** You **take a shot and mark a Stress.** The GM earns a **Fear token.**
4. **If they match (doubles):** *"Crown & Ruin!"* — Choose: **double your banked points** OR **lose them all.** (Teaches risk assessment.)
5. After each roll, you can **stop and bank your points** or **push for another roll.**
6. **First to 20 points wins.**
7. **If you hit 3 Stress, you're bust** — you're out of the round, slumped over the table.

#### GM Notes

- Keep it **fast** — 2-3 rounds max. This is a warm-up, not the main event.
- The Hope/Fear tokens they earn are **real and persist** — they carry into the ambush scene. This makes the game feel consequential.
- If a PC busts out at 3 Stress, that Stress carries forward too. The shots were real. The hangover is real.

#### How the NPCs Play

**Valentine — The Showman**
- **Never banks early.** He'll push to the edge and grin. *"Banking already? How very... cautious of you."*
- **Light-hearted trash talk.** He's not mean — he's *entertaining.* He narrates his rolls like a radio commentator: *"And Sterling rolls again! The crowd goes wild! The dice—oh. Oh no."*
- **Takes his shots with style.** When he marks Stress, he raises the glass, toasts the table, and drinks with a wince he immediately masks. *"Perfectly fine. That one tasted like victory. Delayed victory."*
- **Strategically clever.** He watches other players' risk tolerance and adjusts his commentary to pressure cautious players into pushing: *"You know, my father always said — Fortune doesn't wait for the timid."*
- **If he busts out:** He takes it with exaggerated grace: *"I believe... the room is tilting. That means I've won at something."*

**Ember — The Overachiever**
- **Ultra-aggressive.** She pushes *every single time.* She doesn't understand the concept of banking — it feels like cowardice to her.
- **Treats it like an exam.** She's not playing for fun — she's playing to *prove* she belongs at this table, at this party, in Harmony. Every win is validation.
- **Takes her shots like medicine.** Slams them back without flinching, then immediately asks whose turn it is. No time for sentiment.
- **Observant and calculating.** Despite her aggression, she's watching everyone's tells carefully. She notices who hesitates, who flinches at the dice, who looks at their banked points.
- **Trying too hard to fit in.** She laughs a beat too late at Val's jokes. She uses Harmony slang slightly wrong. She's desperate to be seen as *one of them,* not "the Ash-Blood girl."
- **If she busts out:** Her composure cracks. A flash of genuine frustration — she wanted to win *so badly.* She covers it quickly: *"Again. Let's go again."*

---

### 🃏 Game 2: "Truths & Treachery" *(Truth-or-Lie Social Game)*

**What it teaches:** Contested rolls, how different stats work against each other, retcon narration.

**The Drink:** Same Void Shots. **You take a shot (mark Stress) if you guess wrong.**

#### Rules

1. One player is the **Teller.** They tell the table something about themselves, their clan, their past — **either completely true or a total lie.**
2. The Teller makes a **Presence roll** (stat + 2d12) — this is their "poker face" score. *They do NOT reveal the number yet.*
3. Every other player makes an **Instinct roll** (stat + 2d12) — this is their "read" on the Teller.
4. **The Teller reveals the truth:** Was it real or a lie?
5. **Compare rolls after the reveal:**
   - If your Instinct roll **≥ the Teller's Presence roll**, you guessed correctly. Earn a **Hope token.**
   - If your Instinct roll **< the Teller's Presence roll**, you guessed wrong. **Take a shot. Mark Stress.**
6. **Retcon the guesses:** After the reveal, players narrate what their character's reaction was *in the moment*. The GM asks: *"So [PC], when they said that — what did you think? Did you buy it?"* Players whose rolls succeeded get to say they saw through it; players who failed get to describe being fooled.

#### Why the Retcon Works

- The GM doesn't need to manage a guessing phase — just let everyone roll, reveal, then narrate retroactively.
- This is how Daggerheart handles many social situations: roll first, narrate the fiction to match.
- It lets players practice **collaborative storytelling** — they build the scene after the dice tell them the outcome.
- **Bonus:** Players learn things about each other's backstories through the truths and lies. This is *actual character development* disguised as a drinking game.

#### GM Notes

- Val and Ember go first to demonstrate the format. Then PCs take turns.
- Encourage players to use **real backstory** for their truths — this is free character-building.
- NPC statements are pre-written below — pick 2-3 for each NPC depending on time.
- **Ember is taking mental notes for Valerius's radio show.** Anything juicy the PCs reveal may appear on air later.

#### How the NPCs Play

**Valentine — The Smooth Operator**
- Val treats T&T like a performance. He leans back, steeples his fingers, and delivers each statement like a theatre monologue.
- **High Presence.** He's *genuinely good at lying* — smooth voice, steady eye contact, confident rhythm. His poker face is championship-level.
- **Strategically vulnerable.** He mixes real emotional truths with outrageous lies, making it hard to tell which is which. He *wants* people to underestimate his sincerity.
- When he reads others, he does it with a raised eyebrow and a knowing smile: *"Interesting. Very interesting."*
- **If caught in a lie:** Takes the shot gracefully. *"Well played. I almost had you."*
- **If his truth is doubted:** Genuine flash of hurt he quickly masks. A crack in the armour.

**Ember — The Intensity**
- Ember treats T&T like an interrogation. She leans forward, studies faces, barely blinks.
- **Low Presence, high Instinct.** She's bad at lying (too intense, too earnest) but *excellent* at reading others. She stares right through people.
- When someone tells their statement, Ember is visibly analysing — head tilted, eyes narrowed. She looks like she's trying to decode them.
- **Trying to fit in.** She wants to be fun and casual about it, but she can't help being competitive. She'll say something like *"This is such a fun game!"* with the energy of someone filing a police report.
- **If she guesses wrong:** Takes the shot fast, then immediately explains her reasoning to nobody: *"No, but see, the way you said it — the cadence was—"*
- **When it's her turn to tell:** She gets nervous. These truths cut close to home. Her voice drops. She stops performing.

#### Valentine's Statements

| #   | Statement                                                                                                                                                                    | Truth/Lie | Weight   | GM Notes                                                                                                                                                               |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | *"The [[House Gilded\|Gilded]] Crystal Banks are running out of reserves. If the Global Amplitude doesn't surge soon, the lights go out — and so does my family's fortune."* | **TRUTH** | 🔴 Big   | This is real — the Crystal Banks are insolvent (see [[house-gilded]]). Val knows because he's a Sterling. Delivers it lightly, like it's gossip, but the weight lands. |
| 2   | *"Honestly? I'm here to make my papa proud more than anything else. I like people more than places. I'm not sure I'll make a great explorer."*                               | **TRUTH** | 🟡 Mid   | Genuine vulnerability. He's a social creature forced into an explorer's path. The room gets quiet. Ember looks at him differently.                                     |
| 3   | *"My cousin Valerius started his radio show after he failed out of the Academy. Couldn't hack it as an Exploranaut, so he picked up a microphone instead."*                  | **LIE**   | 🟡 Mid   | Valerius actually graduated — barely, but he did. Val spreads this lie because the rivalry is real and Valerius's ego is a fat target.                                 |
| 4   | *"My father once stole a [[Mizizi]] sapling in the middle of the night. Planted it in our courtyard. It died within a week."*                                                | **LIE**   | 🟠 Fun   | Pure fabrication — Val Sr. is many things but not a botanist. Val delivers it with total sincerity to make it funnier when revealed.                                   |
| 5   | *"I bought one of [[Lucky]]'s answer packets for tomorrow's exam. Half the answers are wrong. The 'Battle of the Six Sails' question? Complete fiction."*                    | **TRUTH** | 🟢 Light | He did buy it, and he did find errors. Low-stakes truth that demonstrates the game format and seeds the Lucky's test hook.                                             |
| 6   | *"My hands have never touched actual dirt. Not once. They're magically treated to look weathered."*                                                                          | **TRUTH** | 🟡 Mid   | This is actually true (see GM notes on his character sheet) — but it sounds so absurd nobody believes it. Val plays it for laughs.                                     |

> **Recommended order:** Start with #5 (light, demonstrates format), then #3 or #4 (fun lies), build to #1 or #2 (emotional weight).

---

#### Ember's Statements

| # | Statement | Truth/Lie | Weight | GM Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | *"The clean fire of Harmony — the crystal energy — it feels more alive to me than the heat of the volcano ever did. The first time I held a battery, I felt... home."* | **TRUTH** | 🔴 Big | This is her deepest truth and the core of her character tension. She means it. Her voice is quiet. If [[Ignatius]] is at the table, this lands like a bomb. |
| 2 | *"Before I came to Vumbua, I'd already started dressing like a Harmony citizen. I was ashamed of fitting in here more than I ever fit in at home."* | **TRUTH** | 🟡 Mid | She's been a modernizer since before the Academy. This isn't new — it's who she's always been. The shame is real. |
| 3 | *"I work for Valerius because he feeds me well. Best meals I've ever had. That's the whole arrangement."* | **LIE** | 🟡 Mid | She works for Valerius because she *admires* him — his command of words, his confidence, his ability to be Harmony-passing. The food is fine. The real payment is belonging. |
| 4 | *"Back on the Isles, I set fire to a warehouse full of traditional fire-oil. On purpose. As a statement."* | **LIE** | 🟠 Fun | Pure invention — Ember is rebellious in spirit but not destructive. She tells this lie because she wants to seem bold and dangerous. The delivery is too intense. Easy to catch. |
| 5 | *"My cousin—"* (she glances at [[Ignatius]]) *"—used to catch salamanders and name them after types of rock. He had one called Igneous. It was the ugliest."* | **TRUTH** | 🟢 Light | A childhood memory. Endearing. Humanizes both Ember and Ignatius. If Ignatius is here, he'll either confirm or deny — either way it's gold. |
| 6 | *"Valerius told me that if I bring him a good enough story tonight, he'll give me my own segment on the show. 'Ember's Embers.' Three minutes, once a week."* | **TRUTH** | 🟡 Mid | This is real — and it reveals her ambition. She doesn't just want to report for Valerius. She wants her own voice. The segment name is embarrassing and she knows it. |

> **Recommended order:** Start with #5 (light, connects to Ignatius), then #4 or #3 (lies), build to #1 or #2 (emotional gut-punches).

---

### Val's Pitch

> *Valentine sets two bottles on the table: one glowing faintly blue, one amber. He grins.*
>
> *"Two games. Pick your poison — literally. Crown & Ruin if you like dice and danger. Truths & Treachery if you think you can lie to my face. Or..."* He leans forward. *"We play both. Winners of Crown buy the next round for Treachery."*



**Player Engagement:**
- Val challenges PCs to play — a chance to bond or rival with him.
- The games are **mechanical tutorials** disguised as roleplay. By the end, players understand Hope/Fear dice, Stress, contested rolls, and spending Hope.
- If PCs ask about the exam, he'll share his analysis of Lucky's test between rounds.
- Callback to Session 1: He remembers [[Ignatius]] from the courtyard handshake incident and may reference it—awkward or playful depending on how PCs approach.

---

#### [[ember|Ember]] — Valerius's Reporter *(First On-Screen Appearance)*

Ember is an [[Ash-Bloods|Ash-Blood]] student and [[Ignatius]]'s childhood cousin. She is attending the Celestial Lounge as a field reporter for [[valerius-sterling|Valerius Sterling]]'s radio show. She is well aware that her boss is currently asleep in the East Parlor, having been there when the disastrous game of Crown & Ruin occurred.

**Why this works for Ember:**
- She's an Ash-Blood who loves the majesty and lore of Harmony—fascinated by the culture, not resentful of it.
- What better way to immerse herself than by sitting on Valerius's staff, being his eyes and ears for juicy gossip?
- This puts her squarely in the "modernizer" camp: embracing Harmony's world while other Ash-Bloods cling to tradition.

**What Ember is doing:**
- Observing the party, taking mental notes or scribbling on a small pad.
- She's not hiding—she's openly working. Students may or may not know she reports to Valerius.

**Player Engagement:**
- [[Ignatius]] encountering his cousin working for a Harmony radio host could be a charged moment—does he see it as betrayal or pragmatism?
- She represents the cultural divide within the [[Ash-Bloods]]: modernizers vs. traditionalists.
- She may try to interview the PCs for the show—giving players a choice about their public image.

---

#### [[valerius-sterling|Valerius Sterling]] — The Sleeping Voice

Valerius physically came to the Celestial Lounge after his late-night broadcast, but he is currently **asleep in a side parlor** (the "East Parlor") after attempting to drink Valentine under the table and failing. He has scouts (like Ember) watching the event and reporting back in case there's any juicy gossip for his radio show when he wakes up.

**GM Note:** Anything noteworthy the PCs do tonight may end up on Valerius's next broadcast—a fun consequence to carry forward. Ember will make sure he gets the notes.

---

### Scene Flow

1. **Arrival** — PCs enter the Celestial Lounge as it's winding down. Describe the fading glamour, sleepy students, emptying tables.
2. **Valentine's Invitation** — Val spots the party and tries to rope them into playing his game. He's friendly, energetic, slightly desperate for company.
3. **Ember Encounter** — PCs notice (or are noticed by) Ember. She's taking notes. If Ignatius is present, this is a family reunion moment.
4. **Exam Talk** — Conversation may drift to tomorrow's exams. Val shares his take on Lucky's test answers. Ember might fish for a quote.
5. **Winding Down** — The Lounge empties further. PCs decide when to leave—setting up the transition to the Ambush.

---

### The Pressure to Leave

> Put the pressure on them to head to bed. If they stay out too late, start marking **Stress**!

The Celestial Lounge staff begin closing up. Other students give the PCs looks—*"You know exams are tomorrow, right?"* The smart move is to leave. The late hour is the ticking clock.

---

## Phase 2: The Ambush

### Setting

**Location:** A dark stretch of campus between the Celestial Lounge and the dorms — perhaps an unlit courtyard or maintenance corridor. Late at night, few witnesses.

**Time:** After the PCs leave the Celestial Lounge. The campus is quiet, most students already in bed before exams.

**Mood:** Sudden shift from warm social energy to cold, tense danger. Shadows, silence, then violence.

---

### The Situation

The PCs are ambushed by **Tus** and **Zyykl**, two burly young men from [[Nstyl]] — the Silent Silt city where sound is physically impossible and everyone communicates through sign language. They don't speak; they *can't* speak. They just attack.

But Tus and Zyykl aren't the real threat — they've been **manipulated** by **Azor**, a street-smart schemer from [[Settika]] who used [[Prism Falls]] water to convince them this was their only shot at redemption.

---

### Azor's Scheme

**The Setup:** Tus and Zyykl both **failed out of the first round of entrance exams.** They're devastated — they came all the way from [[Nstyl]] to prove themselves, and they believed in the Academy more than anything.

**The Con:** Azor tracked them down and used water from [[Prism Falls]] (Settika's node resource — water that reveals the true nature of whatever it touches). He told them:

> *"I know what you really are. The water showed me. You're Exploranauts — real ones. The test was wrong. All you need is a receipt from a current student, and you can retake the exam. The Academy will see they failed the wrong people."*

Tus and Zyykl **believe in the power of the Prism Falls**. Back in [[Nstyl]], Settika's water is respected, almost sacred. If the water says they're Exploranauts, they must be. They're naive, earnest, and desperate.

**The Truth:** Azor knows this won't work. The [[The Loom|Loom]] receipts aren't transferable IDs — they're point-in-time documents. The Loom recognises students based on how they interact with it, not by a piece of paper. Azor doesn't care about helping Tus and Zyykl. He's a mugger, plain and simple.

**The Real Plan:** Azor figured that the only students dumb enough to be out this late — the night before the most important week of most people's lives — would be the **rich and drunk ones.** Prudent students would be asleep. So he waits in the shadows, lets Tus and Zyykl do the dangerous work, and plans to take whatever valuables fall out of pockets during the scuffle.

---

### Key NPCs

#### Azor — The Man from Settika

A world-wise, street-smart manipulator from [[Settika]]. He knows how things work — Loom receipts, Academy bureaucracy, Prism Falls water. He uses that knowledge to exploit people who don't.

**Key traits:**
- **Sneaky and manipulative** — operates through proxies, never gets his hands dirty.
- **Not from a clan** — he's a city kid from [[Settika]], where the Prism Falls resource is just another tool.
- **Knows the con doesn't work** — he told Tus and Zyykl what they wanted to hear. The receipts are worthless.
- **Actual goal:** Mug rich students and disappear before morning.

**During the fight:**
- Azor is **watching from the shadows**, not engaging directly. He lets Tus and Zyykl take the risk.
- If the fight goes badly (PCs are too strong), he may slip away entirely — a loose thread for later.
- If the PCs are losing, he may step in to grab a crystal battery or coin purse.

#### Tus & Zyykl — The Nstyl Brothers

Two large, powerful young men from [[Nstyl]], the city with [[harmony-nodes#13 Nstyl|Silent Silt]] — where all sound is absorbed and everyone communicates through sign language. They will not speak during the encounter because they physically cannot — spoken language doesn't exist in their world.

**Key traits:**
- **Sign language only** — the PCs can't reason with them verbally. A PC who knows sign language could potentially communicate.
- **Names are gestures, not words** — "Tus" and "Zyykl" are outsider approximations of their hand-sign names. Different people pronounce them differently. (See [[harmony-nodes#13 Nstyl|Nstyl naming conventions]].)
- **Naive, not evil** — they genuinely believe they're supposed to be Academy students. Azor used Prism Falls water to convince them. They think they're *reclaiming* something that was wrongly taken.
- **Failed the entrance exam** — they're heartbroken about it. This isn't rage; it's desperation.
- **Burly and strong** — these are big boys. Farm-strong from the Nstyl quarries. Built for labour, not subtlety.
- **If defeated:** They seem confused and ashamed. Once the adrenaline fades, they realise something is wrong. If a PC can communicate in sign language, Tus will try to explain — *"The water said we were real. The man said the paper would prove it."*

---

### Encounter Composition

Based on Daggerheart SRD p76-77 (Jagged Knife adversaries), reskinned:

- **Azor** → Jagged Knife **Lieutenant** (the manipulator in the shadows)
- **Tus & Zyykl** → Jagged Knife **Lackey** ×2 groups (the muscle)

![[Screenshot_20260222_180117_OneDrive.jpg]]

#### Azor — Reskinned Jagged Knife Lieutenant *(×1)*

> *Tier 1 Leader — "The Man from Settika"*

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Difficulty** | 13 |
| **Thresholds** | 7/14 |
| **HP** | 6 |
| **Stress** | 3 |
| **ATK** | +2 |
| **Weapon** | Close | 1d8+3 phy |
| **Experience** | Streetwise +2, Deception +2 |

**Features:**
- **Puppeteer — Action:** When you spotlight Azor, **mark a Stress** to also spotlight Tus or Zyykl within Close range.
- **Reinforcements — Action:** Summon three additional Nstyl Runners (Lackeys), who appear at Far range. *(Flavour: Azor whistles and more duped Nstyl kids emerge from the dark.)*
- **Coup de Grace — Action: Spend a Fear** to make an attack against a Vulnerable target within Close range. On a success, deal **2d6+12** physical damage and the target must mark a Stress. *(Flavour: Azor steps out of the shadows to strike when someone's down.)*
- **Slippery — Reaction:** When Azor takes damage, he can **mark a Stress** to disengage and move to Far range. *(Flavour: He's a runner, not a fighter.)*

> **GM Note:** Azor only enters combat if forced. Ideally, he's at Far range coordinating while Tus and Zyykl do the work. If both Lackey groups are defeated, Azor may try to flee — this creates a moral choice (chase the mastermind or tend to the wounded Nstyl boys?).

#### Tus & Zyykl — Reskinned Jagged Knife Lackey *(×2 groups)*

> *Tier 1 Minion — Nstyl Bruisers*

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Difficulty** | 9 |
| **Thresholds** | None |
| **HP** | 1 |
| **Stress** | 1 |
| **ATK** | −2 |
| **Weapon** | Melee | 2 phy |
| **Experience** | Grappling +2 |

**Features:**
- **Minion (3) — Passive:** Defeated when they take any damage. For every 3 damage a PC deals to a Lackey, defeat an additional Minion within range.
- **Group Attack — Action: Spend a Fear** to choose a target and spotlight all Lackey units within Close range. Those Minions move into Melee range and make one shared attack roll. On a success, they each deal 2 physical damage. Combine this damage. *(Flavour: They coordinate through hand signals — fast, silent, eerie.)*

> **GM Note:** Tus and Zyykl each lead a group of 3 minions. They fight with brute force and sign-language coordination. They're scary because of their silence — no battle cries, no taunts, just hand signals and sudden violence. A PC who watches carefully can read their signals with an **Instinct** roll.

---

### Scene Flow

1. **The Walk Home** — PCs leave the Celestial Lounge, tired, maybe laughing about Val's antics. Describe the campus growing quiet and dark.
2. **Something's Wrong** — Perception or Instinct check. Shadows moving wrong. Silence that's *too* silent. *(The Nstyl boys are naturally silent — they don't make noise.)*
3. **The Ambush** — Tus and Zyykl strike from the dark. No warning, no demands, no speech — just sign-language coordination and violence.
4. **The Fight** — Standard Daggerheart combat with the stat blocks above. The sign-language-only communication is disorienting for the PCs.
5. **Resolution** — When defeated/subdued, the PCs can try to communicate with the Nstyl fighters. If anyone knows sign language or uses creative solutions, they might learn about Azor and the Prism Falls water.
6. **Aftermath** — Questions left hanging: Who is Azor? Why did the Prism Falls water "lie"? (It didn't — it reveals *true nature*, and maybe these boys *do* have what it takes. The Loom just doesn't agree.)

### Post-Combat

- **If PCs try to communicate:** Tus and Zyykl seem confused and ashamed once the fight drains out of them. They may be willing to sign their story — *"The water said we were real. The man said the paper would prove it."* — but only if someone can understand them.
- **If PCs report to authorities:** Academy staff take it seriously but may not act quickly. Bureaucracy. Plus, failed-out students attacking current ones is embarrassing for the Academy.
- **If PCs investigate on their own:** Seeds for a future subplot involving Azor and whatever he's really after.
- **If PCs helped Tus & Zyykl:** This could pay off later — the Nstyl brothers remember kindness. There's a possible ally thread here.

---

## What Actually Happened (Session 3)

- **The Lounge:** The party played Crown & Ruin with Valentine. Valentine got drunk and revealed he sold his exam "study guide" to Lucky.
- **The Ambush:** Britt spotted Azor, Zyykl, and Tus and approached them. Azor led Britt into an alley where she was ambushed. She took heavy damage, used all her armor slots, and lost her test receipt but fought back to protect her heirloom petrified acorn necklace.
- **The Interrogation:** Iggy, Lomi, and Aggie arrived. Britt pinned Azor and took his pocket watch as compensation for the mugging. Lomi, disgusted by Azor's lack of remorse, brutally punched the defeated Settikan in the gut, breaking his rib.
- **The Plan:** Tomorrow, the party plans to track down Lucky and use Azor's pocket watch and the embellished story of Lomi breaking ribs to leverage/intimidate him into handing over the study guide.
