[sleepily] Good evening, [[Vumbua Academy]]! [long loud yawn]

This is **[[Valentine Sterling]]** coming to you [deliberate] LIVE and admittedly a bit sleepy from the back room of the Celestial Lounge. The first night has come and gone — and I must say... [excited] WHAT A NIGHT IT WAS. DRAMA. new LOVE and broken hearts!!! It is shaping up to [excited] be a GREAT YEAR

...

For those of you daring enough... reckless enough... or just too [excited] CONFIDENT to sleep... well good on you: **MOMENTUM. IS. LIFE.**

...

But a word of warning to the "uncalibrated": [deliberate] Not everyone who missed the cut is happy about having their dreams dashed. The late-night crowd? They can get a little... [whispering] *dicey* [normal] after intake. Keep your head on a swivel — or you might find yourself a bit... distracted when the sun comes up.

...

That said... tomorrow; the REAL work begins! It's time to pick your classes and take that all-important placement test. 

And make no mistake... after this week... [deliberate] **ONLY FIFTY THOUSAND** will remain. 

...

So bring your best. Because I *also* hear there is a [excited] **RESO-RACE** coming after the first week of classes! [normal] Which will be a *perfect* place to prove your metal to the Captains. 

Sleep well, cadets. You're going to need it. 

[deliberate] **Sterling out.**
